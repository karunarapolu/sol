Cheaper SDRs use a low-quality crystal oscillator which usually has a large offset from the ideal frequency. Furthermore, that frequency offset will change as the dongle warms up or as the ambient temperature changes. The end result is that any signals received will not be at the correct frequency, and they would drift as the temperature changes. 
CalibrateSDR can be used with almost any SDR to determine the frequency offset. As of now, it uses the synchronization channel symbols from DAB+ digital audio stations to determine the offset. The primary focus of this project is to extend the applicability towards more signal standards, so as to make it helpful for the SDR community. As DAB+ is mainly used in Europe, Signal standards like GSM, LTE, NOAA-Weather Satellites, DVB-T (use their sync pulses within the data) can be used. Currently, it uses the pyrtlsdr package, which makes it work with RTL-SDR. Piping the API to work with other SDRs will also make the project have a wide range of applications in the SDR Community.</p>

<p>Our main task involves the WebGPU Shading Language, a new shading language featured by WebGPU. Since web browsers will have WebGPU, a secure implementation is crucial. To achieve a high test coverage, we use coverage-guided fuzzing. It uses program instrumentation to trace the code coverage reached by each input fed to a fuzz target. The information is then used to make informed decisions that maximize coverage, and thus increase the effectiveness of finding software bugs and security vulnerabilities.

<li>The Business-Logic/API-calls and the UI part of the app needs to be separated in the right way. Right now, All the API 
calls are made from the UI class itself.</li>
<li>The UI/UX of the app also need improvements, especially the Profile and Intro screens. And the app also lacks some 
basic features like Form validation, Profile Picture selection during the Registration process, Using Gallery as a Source 
for the image at the time of Monument Detection etc.</li>

I am going to enable deep linking and allow users to vote through the app itself. Adding a search bar to search elections is on my to-do list. Manually adding every voter and candidate can be hectic for a large list, so I plan to make it easier by importing these data from excel sheets. I will be adding more visualization techniques in Result Fragment and also export the result in excel format to external apps or share it as a png file. I will connect the application to Firebase, and enable crashlytics, analytics, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for better app retention.

Being a master student in philology, and having some experience in the creation of language resources, I would like to propose to implement new language pair: Kazakh - Uzbek for Apertium, as these two languages are both low-resource Turkic languages that are official languages of two respective Central Asian countries with so many economical and cultural relationships. But this language pair still lacks an open-source machine translation system. 
My proposal is to fill this gap as much as possible during this GSoC2021 program. 
Since Uzbek and Kazakh languages from the same language family, they are closely related in terms of grammar, word order and similarity in vocabulary, so I will try to make a bidirectional translation, with a more focus on Kazakh -&gt; Uzbek side, as Uzbek is my native language and I possess very basic knowledge in Kazakh.</p>

ArduPilot’s implementation has been tested in several conditions and has been proven to work. Yet, there are a few shortcomings in the codebase that have become an impediment and require improvement. Depth cameras have also proved to be extremely useful in increasing the situational awareness of the environment. Improving ArduPilot’s precision landing capabilities combined with the powers of a Depth Camera should make a robust approach to this unique problem.</p>

Although the vast majority of SOTA source separation algorithms are built using Python-based frameworks, PyTorch’s C++ torchscript API provides an elegant solution for deploying python models in C++ applications. In Audacity, this would introduce the opportunity for the user to choose from a collection of domain-specific pretrained models, each suited for a different task (e.g. speech or music).  Additionally, it would set the foundational code for future integration of deep models designed for different tasks, such as speech recognition and audio classification. The goal of this work is not only to integrate source separation algorithms into Audacity, but more importantly to lay the groundwork for an extensible suite of open-source, deep learning-based music information retrieval (MIR) tools hosted by the world’s most popular free and open-source audio editor.</p>

Apparently for the time being the GPU block lies mostly useless and cannot assist with any computations due to non-technical reasons. Normally, OpenCL would be used for accelerating on the GPU, but taking the limitations discussed above it is impossible, yet there is another way! GPGPU acceleration with OpenGLES.</p>
<p>The GPU accelerators from PowerVR (series SGX500) are available in all BB's and a unified acceleration framework for them is the topic of this proposal. The targeted version of OpenGL ES is 2.0, but extending it to the future versions will not be a problem from a technical point of view as the newer versions are backwards compatible. The API of the library will allow for performing various mathematical operations, and will return the results to the user in the same format they input the data in.</p>
<p>Apart from the library, the project will explore the performance gains when using the GPU (compared to the CPU) and provide the user with guidelines on when it is feasible to put the BB's GPU accelerator to use and when to refrain from it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Renewing configuartion</strong>
BenchRoutes require API configuration from the user for monitoring the endpoints. The configuration is actually parsed from a file config.yml. We are required to make a new config design and a new parser package that will parse the new config design.</li>
<li><strong>Revamping the design pattern and adding Scheduler</strong>
Bench-route monitor API endpoints by launching go-routines for each-endpoints with different workers concurrently. However, there are multiple problems with this system.We need to redesign the architecture of scraping the metrics with a dedicated scheduler for scheduling the go-routines.</li>
<li><strong>Writing Querier package &amp; API Integration</strong>
Since the base architecture of BenchRoute will be changed due to the last two ideas, the earlier APIs need to be changed with new APIs according to the client requirements. Also, a new TSDB has been integrated with the new Designs, hence querying data from TSDB requires a new Querier package.</li>

In PEP554,  peoplecame up with the idea of multi-interpreter in the same program.  Which can start multiple in-terpreter concurrently to solve the problem.  But due to some reasons, it wasn’t be implementedin Python 3.9
Thanks to boost::asio::iocontext::strand, it’s possible for us to use multiple Python interpretersin the same program in theactor modelfashion.  Hereby I propose this project to implementPython eventloop usingboost::asio::iocontext::strand
Those developers who wants to use numerous Python libraries and share rich Python ecosystemwill benefit from this project.</p>

However, to allow for a large variety of endpoint types to integrate with Ceph, we are encountered with some inconvenience on these various protocols from different service infrastructure. The workaround for the notification brings the burden of adaptor deployment, communication and translation overhead.AMQP 1.0 is the latest standard for AMQP. It focuses on core features which are necessary for interoperability at Internet scale, and it contains less explicit routing than previous versions. Even though Ceph has supported the AMQP(ver 0.9.1) natively, the gap between these two protocol specifications cannot be ignored. The next level AMQP(ver 1.0) requires a completely different client library.  AMQP 1.0 brokers are supported by Apache Qpid/ActiveMQ project and Azure platform, etc. To address this problem, we should support the AMQP 1.0 natively in the Ceph Rados Gateway. This requires adding the qpid-proton client library to the Rados Gateway code base, and use it to send notifications to AMQP 1.0 compatible brokers.</p>

The future upgrade of the LHC will add new challenges for CMS detector due to the larger amount of data that will be produced. 
One solution is to look towards a heterogeneous High-Level Trigger (HLT) Computing Farm, where the computing load can be distributed among different hardware (CPU, GPU, FPGAS). This project aims to use Portability Libraries like Alpaka to write code for the CMS Software (CMSSW), in order to have a single implementation which will be compiled on different architectures. 
In the last years, a new pixel track reconstruction that can run on GPUs (CUDA) has been implemented. The goals are to port the current CUDA implementation with Alpaka, in order to understand if this library is feasible for CMSSW and to compare the timing performances between Alpaka implementation and native CUDA.</p>

Hence, the ATLAS experiment at the LHC uses a trigger system, which selects and transfers interesting events to the data storage system. However, if those events are buried in large backgrounds and difficult to identify as a signal by the trigger system, they will also be discarded together with the background. To alleviate this problem, various compression algorithms are proposed to reduce the size of the data that is recorded. One of those algorithms is an autoencoder (AE) network that tries to implement an approximation to the identity, f(x) = x. Its goal is to create a lower-dimensional representation of the input data in a latent space. Then using this latent representation the model can reconstruct its input. Moreover, two advanced families of AEs are proposed, the Variational and the Adversarial AE. Next, various combinations of different compression algorithms are tested to compress and construct accurate representations of the input data. Finally, the studied AEs are implemented for anomaly detection.</p>

These strategies assign a cost to each edge collapse so that edges can be iteratively collapsed in order of least cost until a condition is met.</p>
<p>Our focus is on the latter of the two strategies, which uses quadrics at each vertex to calculate a cost. The paper <a href=""https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/publication/03308/"" target=""_blank"">Fast and Robust QEF Minimization using Probabilistic Quadrics</a> explores the use of probabilistic - as opposed to classic - quadrics and shows that in many use cases, including but not limited to mesh decimation, probabilistic quadrics give better results, are more robust and about as efficient as classical quadrics.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to introduce support for probabilistic quadrics in the context of mesh decimation in CGAL, which would improve the library's capability to quickly generate highly desirable mesh simplifications.</p>

I will also upgrade both Gitmate and IGitt to the latest API versions of Github, Gitlab and Jira and add support for the latest python versions by upgrading the dependencies. Along with this, I will update various aspects of the documentation of both these projects, improve testing, and ensure that the Continuous Integration setup is in perfect condition. The last phase of my project will involve merging three pull request plugins into a combined plugin and improving various pull request events. 
Throughout the project, I will work on feedback from the coala community and try my utmost best to improve their experience with using Gitmate.</p>

In addition, it is intended to add a comparative element between versions of the same language which will help to appreciate changes from one version to another (number of entities, types of entities, trends of each version, etc.).

Our task then is to extract the cause-effect entity pairs (e.g., Peaceful_Revolution, German_reunification) from the wikipedia text. We combine the idea of using the seed data (e.g., the known cause-effect entity pairs) with training a classifier (e.g., a discriminative model--- LSTM ), so as to discover more cause-effect entity pairs from wikipedia text, which is known as distant supervised relation extraction. The procedures include the pattern matching, knowledge exploration, entity recognition, entity mapping, etc. Eventually, we aim to acquire more reliable causal relations between entities of DBpedia.</p>

These tests can then be automated whenever, say, a PR is opened to make sure the proposed changes are non-breaking.</p>

A deferred length variable is either <code>pointer</code> or <code>allocatable</code>. Compiler during execution allocates space based upon the value to be assigned to a variable.<br>
<em>For eg:</em> If the value to be assigned to a character variable is <code>""spiderman""</code>, then the compiler will automatically allocate a space required to store this character sequence of length 9 and a reference to this space will be stored in the variable. Similarly, if a new character sequence, let’s say, <code>""batman""</code>(which is of length 6) is assigned to this same variable then the compiler will allocate a space required to store <code>""batman""</code> and a reference to this space will overwrite the previously stored reference in the variable. Thus, space required by the variable is constant as it is not storing the actual character sequence and is rather storing the reference to the space where the character sequence is actually stored.</p>

<p>FOSSology’s build system is based on multilevel makefiles that work together to provide a build infrastructure for the project. Although make is a robust build system but it is too outdated and slow compared to modern build systems. Although build configurations are not supposed to be updated as often as source files, there are few noticeable problems with make. This project will migrate the build system to more user freindly and popular CMake.</p>

Nomos and Monk are the two leading scanners FOSSology uses for license detection and Copyright for scanning copyright,url,emails and holders name. FOSSology approach is to detect licenses with either a large (large: 2500 regexes) dataset of regex patterns (nomos) or a full string comparison against license full texts (large: ~400 text) (monk). Atarashi license scanner implements multiple text statistics and information retrieval algorithms. 
ScanCode Toolkit is a very established license scanner similar to Nomos or Monk. It is a simple python based command line scanner that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It implements a number of different approaches and integrates these into one application for identifying and classifying license relevant content in packages.
The basic idea is to use the command line interface from the ScanCode package in order to be called right from the FOSSology application. FOSSology will pass a single file and take the result from the ScanCode command line call. Scan result will include license name, the SPDX key, Score, Copyright and Holder name, Emails and Urls present in the given code and as per requested by the user.</p>

These types of simulations are a necessary step in any hardware design. It is intrinsically a hard problem, and even commercial simulators run slow compared to the real hardware, which can be several orders of magnitude faster. On the open-source side, Verilator is one of the most famous players and offers a competitive simulation speed time compared to the closed-source ones. We will base our work on this tool. 
This project will consider that modern processors rely on Network-On-Chip (NoC) to communicate several cores in the same chip. The idea would be to use this hardware partition into consideration and make a stand-alone simulation per core and communicate through OpenMPI. This could potentially enable the simulation of a 1000-core processor, something currently unmanageable.</p>

With sweeply increasing computing speed, instructions might spend much of their time in waiting queues during read-store access. Nevertheless, there are also many available OS and microarchitecture designs for solving this performance complication. One of the important is the multi-level Translation Lookahead Buffer(TLB) Implementation. Based on the cache locality principle, it aids to keep the frequently used address translations near the core, hence amortizes the waiting time for instruction fetching and load-store units. With many levels in place, the less is the frequency of misses, the better is the performance. Thus, this proposal will aim to enhance the current TLB structure of the CVA6 (Ariane) core to a multi-level with L2 TLB on top of the existing L1 TLBs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Portability: Non-POSIX systems like Windows don’t play nice with shell script commands like grep, cd and printf, to name a few, and these commands have to be reimplemented for the system. There are also POSIX to Windows path conversion issues.</li>
<li>No direct access to plumbing: Shell commands do not have direct access to the low level Git API, and a separate shell is spawned to just to carry out their operations.</li>
<li>Performance: Shell scripts tend to create a lot of child processes which slows down the functioning of these commands, especially with large repositories.</li>

Because, the entire security of the file backend relies on the user's login password (single point of failure). This situation can be improved if the keys are protected/generated by hardware.

The behavior of the electromagnetic wave is closely dependent on the material in which it propagates. Some dispersive media have quite complex electromagnetic properties depending on the wavelength. This, for example, means that for different frequencies the wave can propagate with a different speed in different materials. This significantly affects the solver’s output. The main goal of the project is to enhance series of scripts, which modelled electromagnetic properties of the variety range of materials. Initial series of scripts have been prepared, however, their technical improvement and coupling with main software gprMax is required.</p>

Its compiler internally uses a Term Rewriting System (TRS) in order to simplify complex expressions, which comprises over a thousand handwritten rewrite rules added by human compiler engineers. In order to strengthen the TRS by finding new rules that can rewrite input expressions that the TRS currently fails to simplify, a synthesizer was used to automatically generate 4127 verifiably sound rules. Experiments have shown that adding these rules lowers peak memory usage by up to 50%, while having relatively insignificant impact on runtime performance. However, adding every such rule increases compile-time and compiler code size. This project aims to address this problem by incrementally testing and assessing each rule and subsets of the rules, while adding them to the compiler only if they necessarily contribute to the peak memory reductions shown in the experiment or other improvements in performance.</p>

While the untyped version can initially be easier to use and experiment with, the typed version offers static analysis of tensor’s shape, layout, precision, and compute device. The typed version not only helps with debugging and maintainability but also offers better support for type-driven development via GHC features like type holes. However, it is currently difficult to mix the two approaches, e.g., statically specifying tensor’s embedding size while keeping other dimensions unchecked is not possible. Gradual typing is the proposed solution that fuses the two APIs by adding Torch.GraduallyTyped type. The new API allows for more granular control by letting the user choose which properties of the tensor should be given a static type. The goal of the project is to bring maturity to the gradually typed tensor API, add missing features, and experiment with new ideas.</p>

The idea of having human-readable configuration files is also explored since this would help the sharing of common conversion parameters within similar communities.

The developed solution offers scientists a quick and easy way of obtaining population-specific tractography atlases in an automated fashion. The algorithm takes segmented bundles as input and relies on streamline based registration to align the bundles and construct an atlas. The whole atlas creation process is controlled by the user via a command line interface. Obtained atlases can be exported and used for visualization or further analyses.</p>

This tutorial is not only a fully constructed 8-cell circuit that can generate heart rhythms, but also a great teaching tool thanks to the visual interface where a student can turn on synaptic connections or change maximal ionic conductances. However, the original tutorial has been developed using the now obsolete Genesis simulator. Unfortunately, running the Genesis simulator nowadays requires complicated software set up that prevents many non-technical students from accessing the tutorial. We had previously started porting the tutorial to a more modern format that can be executed through a web browser (see  8-cell Leech Heartbeat Network Model Tutorial), increasing the accessibility of this classic tutorial for teaching and research purposes. At this summer’s GSoC, we would like to finish this port and make the tutorial available. We selected the Neuron simulator language for running the model using NeuroML and Python as the description languages.</p>

Previously developed active segmentation platform as a plugin for ImageJ incorporate Weka toolbox-based statistical machine learning algorithms as well as deep learning techniques for trainable image segmentation. The end goal of the active segmentation platform for ImageJ is to provide researchers an extensible toolbox enabling them to select custom filters and machine learning algorithms for their research. Under the existing implementation of the active segmentation platform, it only supports users with a limited way to load the ground truth for learning ( at the moment only as of the region on interest format (ROI)). Thus, this reduced the usability of the tool and it urges the users to convert the ground truth to the specific format which is designed to be used within the application. Therefore the main contributions under this project will be to incorporate several ground-truth formats as image-based in which each pixel uniquely belongs to a particular class, partial ground truth format in which instead of the whole image and several partial boxes in an image or stack are labeled.</p>

<p>I am very interested in programming in a lot of different programming languages. Currently I am studying Computer Science in Graz (Austria). I would propose to the iOS team where I already contributed some new features and therefore already have an overview how the app is built.</p>
<p>INTEREST: Pocket Code for iOS: Support for Catrobat Language version 0.994 - 0.99992. This task seems interesting to me and I would like to implement it during the summer to bring also some new compatibilities to the iOS app.</p>
<p>Since I already contributed to your amazing project and really liked it a lot also because I learned a lot of new things and because I think it has a lot of potential I am really looking forward to work with you also in the Google Summer of code.</p>

The game is inspired by a hugely popular 2D game “Hollow Knight”.
The main character of the game is Batro who is the king of the Batona kingdom. At each level, king Batro fights with one of the evil monsters and crosses the hurdles and In the last level, the king fights with Giant Monster Martian and frees his Kingdom from the evil Monsters.
The player follows Batro in his journey. The game story is easily depicted through cinematic cutscenes for better insight. The game is very easy to play and get into, with on-screen controls, and a fairly simple UI. The game is playable on both phones and on a smart TV without looking at the phone's screen while using the phone as a gamepad. This game shows how the ‘Pocket Code’ app can be used to develop high-quality video games if used efficiently and effectively.</p>

Currently, SPF integrates a limited set of dated string constraint solvers. Since string constraint solvers constantly evolve, there is a continuing need to integrate them with SPF. Adding a new string constraint solver into SPF involves augmentation to the existing SPF code. An in-depth understanding of the SPF solver interface is necessary to accomplish this integration. These obstacles lead to a lack of support for state-of-the-art string constraint solvers in SPF. This proposal outlines changes to SPF that would allow integration of Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-LIB) compliant solvers with minimal effort and no modifications to existing code. Further, string constraint solvers that are not fully SMT-LIB compliant and require specific translations could be integrated with the addition of a single translation class and no modifications to existing code.</p>

For example, radiation may induce error to the hardware and some bit might be flipped. It is important to improve the resiliency of software against hardware errors. One way to evaluate the resiliency of software against hardware errors is by fault injection. Using Java PathFinder, we can explore how a Java program acts for hardware errors.

The target benchmark to beat would be “1 auth and rep (using authrep.xml endpoint)” per request. The filter will be written in Rust and then later “translated” into WASM code packaged as WASM Module which is loaded on WASM VMs spun up by a runtime (V8, WAVM, or Wasmtime) embedded inside the Envoy. Many advantages come with using the WASM module instead of the native C++ extension like dynamically loading the filter extension, abstraction from the underlying CPU and programming language used, and being safe from crashing the proxy when a developer makes a mistake. Even though the module is sandboxed, it has the capability for I/O as described in the ABI Specification which empowers us with access to shared data storage (key-value based) and a message queue used in this project.</p>

Industrial Robotics is an open-source collection of resources for JdeRobot and exercises for autonomous robotics manipulation. Last year, they incorporated three exercises based on robot manipulation and navigation. Now, the plan is to extend these exercises to Web Templates. For each exercise, a template performs all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student’s code. Using this template, the student focuses on robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details with little educational value.</p>

However, the presence of 2 separate pipelines for RL and DL is confusing to the users. The DL base works on the JDERobot app, while the RL base takes the privilege of gym-gazebo. These two bases are unable to communicate with each other. Also, the current framework does not leverage the full capabilities of testing scenarios and robots. Apart from line-following, F1 racing for autonomous maneuvers and drone racing has gained much popularity. Although these settings are highly derivative, it requires few significant changes in the control architecture and modularity wrt multiple robot settings. This project’s primary goal is to move towards more extensive support and documentation of Behavior Studio to suit the same RL environment or DL brain to multiple robots with continuous control integration. The advantages of such changes will make the framework more user-friendly and adaptive to various tasks and robot settings.</p>

In this way the user would have to upload a trained model through a user-friendly web template, the model must match the defined set of inputs(e.g. Single or multiple images) and outputs(e.g. 2D coordinates).
This would help replace the previous requirements of manually coding the behavior of the robot. Finally, we would also be building new exercises in the Robotics Academy which make use of this new paradigm.</p>

Web accessibility means designing and developing your website so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with, and contribute to the Web. Occasionally, the dispute over the definition of accessibility is revived.
In fact, there are no contradictions between the two approaches. Design that recognizes the needs of all people also serves people with disabilities. Designing, for people with disabilities, brings benefits to all people - also people without disabilities. However, the term ""accessibility"" was defined to draw the attention of designers, not just web designers, to the specific needs of people with disabilities.
W3C set up a Web Accessibility Initiative whose mission is to ensure that the web is accessible to people with disabilities including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.</p>

KIO-FUSE has not been through regression tests and chances are, doing so would uncover bugs that previously went undetected. KIO-FUSE is updated fairly frequently and new features are still being added, making regression testing a necessity to prevent new bugs from creeping in.</p>
<p>The lack of regression tests in KIO-FUSE's current testing suite can be fixed by integrating XFSTESTS with it. XFSTESTS is considered as the quintessential filesystem regression testing suite and KIO-FUSE would benefit greatly from it. A more rigorous testing regime would translate to an even more robust and reliable filesystem. Testing KIO-FUSE would mean we're testing KIO slaves as well. As of now, XFSTESTS doesn't support FUSE, and that'll have to be added as a part of this project. FUSE support for XFSTESTS would be a major plus since it'd allow hundreds of filesystems written using FUSE to be tested.</p>

Carl Schwan recently began developing a proof-of-concept Kirigami ‘Kalendar’ application that supports a detailed month view and works with Akonadi calendars, but that is currently a work-in-progress project.</p>
<p>This proposal puts forward a plan for improvements to this existing proof of concept that would help implement a fully-featured convergent calendar application for Plasma Mobile. This application would allow the user to view, create, modify, and delete calendar events with full Akonadi integration. This will be made possible by creating components written in QML and Kirigami that should allow for the creation of a visually-attractive and intuitive calendar view components that could be used in any Kirigami application.</p>

Face engine is a tool helping users recognize and label faces in photos. Following the advance of Deep Learning, digiKam development team has been working on the Deep Learning implementation of Faces engine since 2018.  During the past few years, with the huge effort of digiKam developers and the great support from users, the Faces engine has been improved gradually.</p>
<p>However, the Faces engine still has some issues that were not yet eliminated. For example, in the core algorithm, we still get many false positives because the faces engine tries to include all the faces to the known range of labels. In the face pipeline, a lot of implicit memory conversion between QImage, DImg and OpenCV Mat, which for some reasons, adds noise to the images.</p>
<p>Therefore, for this 2021 Google Summer of Code, we are going to improve the  detection/recognition performance with outlier faces suppression (i.e. new faces should not be counted as untagged faces), the ability to work on large datasets, and an ease-of-use face workflow improvement.</p>

<p>An EHR is a digital real-time, patient-centered record that makes information available instantly and securely to authorized users. This involves a lot of data and information transfer requiring a standard data model for improving interoperability which is given by FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Specification.</p>
<p>In the previous versions of GSoC this project was primarily based on creating web components for the FHIR resources with a goal to simplify the making of an EHR. For this year primary focus will be on refactoring and improving the components by implementing a demo EHR system utilising the FHIR components that will be created to be used together along with the components that are already present.</p>

Implementing table styles in Writer is an ongoing effort for a long time now. However, some major steps are already done, like implementing the table style support in the Writer model, or implementing the ODF import and export filters,  there is still a lot of work to be done. This project would aim to do the DOCX import part of it.</p>
<p>The problem with the current import is that table styles found in DOCX documents are converted into direct formatting at the level of Writer core. This temporarly solution works fine until someone wants to edit the table, which can cause loss of formatting now. Furthermore, doing this conversion upon opening a DOCX document is very slow.</p>
<p>The aim of my project would be implementing the DOCX import of table styles and removing the current style-based formatting conversion to direct formatting. This task may cause the need of extending the existing table style features in Writer. For example, an important, not yet supported property is style inheritance.</p>

This project explores the scope of use of equivariant neural networks that can benefit from inherent symmetry present in natural images. We will be implementing and benchmarking the results of equivariant neural networks on the available DeepLens simulated dataset. We will also integrate all these architectures with the DeepLens pipeline to provide a high-level interface for future work.</p>

near Geneva, Switzerland. The CMS experiment detects the resulting particles from the collusion and measures their kinematics using various sub detectors working in concert. High momentum muons are significant objects for many physics analyses at CMS. Therefore, an accurate momentum assignment scheme differentiating low momentum muons (background) from high momentum muons (signal) is crucial to the Endcap Muon Track Finder (EMTF) trigger. The first algorithm implemented in the trigger system was a discretized boosted decision tree. In this study, we will study the use of deep learning algorithms at the trigger level that requires microsecond level latency and therefore highly optimized inference. We will develop and benchmark the graph neural networks (GNN) for momentum regression in the trigger system. As deliverables, we will present the benchmarkings of deep network model inference for muon momentum assignment for prompt and displaced particles.</p>

For this reason, alternative methods based on machine learning can provide faster solutions, while maintaining a high level of fidelity.

One of the challenges of studying dark matter is actually finding it, as it is only noticeable due to gravitational interactions. Fortunately, recent results have shown that strong gravitational lensing can be used as a probe for studying dark matter’s substructure. Unsupervised learning algorithms are particularly interesting in this field because they allow for the identification of dark matter substructure without a prior theoretical model assumption. While the performance of these algorithms is very promising, there is still a large gap when compared to supervised learning algorithms. One promising possibility is to use domain adaptation techniques to fine tune the models trained on simulation data with real data. Thus, this project will focus on using domain adaptation to account for the differences in the modelling and available real observation data, while also improving the interface with PyAutoLens, the software used for creating the strong lens simulations.</p>

One of the core ideas of Matrix is interoperability. Having the option to communicate with everyone without having to worry if the other person is also on the same platform as you are is a major concern while switching to another communication platform.</p>
<p>The entry barrier to the Matrix ecosystem is lower as compared to similar projects due to the support of bridges. IRC, Telegram, Slack, Signal and Gitter bridges, to name a few, have reduced the barrier very much. By bringing email support to the ecosystem, we will be able to push the barrier to almost nil. Imagine the matrix system which will be able to communicate with virtually everyone that has a personal internet address!, i.e, the email ID.</p>

The core elements of biological membranes, phospholipids, provide tridimensional configurations from which a surface can be derived to calculate curvature descriptors. We would like to integrate to MDAnalysis an analysis module to calculate averaged mean and Gaussian curvature from Molecular Dynamics simulations. By integrating a membrane curvature analysis module in MDAnalysis, users will benefit from a tool that enables rapid extraction of relevant properties of lipid bilayers in biomolecular systems. Our approach extracts key elements of the membrane using phospholipid head groups to define a surface, followed by a transformation into NumPy arrays. In this way, the functionality offered by NumPy and SciPy can be used to derive values of mean and gaussian curvature of biological membranes. Since MDAnalysis already works very well to explore data interactively, visualization of the membrane curvature analysis outputs in 2D-maps can be easily performed.</p>

<h4>Closing Feature gaps between meterpreter, shell and powershell sessions</h4>
<p>Many Post APIs like get_processes, search, stat were supported by meterpreter sessions but not by shell sessions. Even if the APIs were present they were not working as expected. In an ideal case a module writer would want the APIs to take the same parameters, return the same results and fail on the same conditions.</p>
<h4>Fix localization Issues</h4>
<p>If the session is from an OS of different language, there can be some issues where the module might break because of wrong output strings received in the process of post exploitation. This part fixes those kind of bugs.</p>
<h4>Enhancements for powershell sessions</h4>
<p>As a scripting language, PowerShell is commonly used for automating the management of systems and can be a treasure for the attackers if present on the target system because of it's rich functionality. But at most places in the POST APIs powershell session type was not supported and was depended upon OS specific commands for operations. This project adds the use of powershell cmdlets for all the post exploitation methods.</p>

This project improves the following aspects of the animation portion of MIT App Inventor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enabling users to choose a custom origin for image sprites using a drag-able marker. The origin of a sprite is the root of the sprite's coordinate system. All of the interactions of the sprite that may include collisions, positioning etc. is with respect to the origin. This project implements the desired functionality of custom origin in the appinventor system and adds an interactive way, via a drag-able marker, for selecting this origin easily.  </li>
<li>Improving the algorithm used to detect collisions among sprites. Right now appinventor uses a naive algorithm to detect collisions between sprites. This collision detection does not work correctly for rotated image sprites and they are treated as if they were unrotated. This projects implements the SAT collision detection algorithm that replaces the naive implementation. This helps detect collisions in rotated image sprites and is more extensible.</li>

This has primarily been the case due to its more robust memory management and faster execution when compared to C/C++. Rust’s features are advantageous while building scientific software since there’s often a large amount of data to analyse, and performance is one of the most critical concerns. Hence, Rust is now being applied to the development of bioinformatics tools as well. In the future, these tools will be increasingly used online, and implementation in the Rust language is expected to ensure the safety of these tools. This project aims to demonstrate the suitability of Rust to the development of a simulator for SBML models.</p>

The information in an SBML model file is organized as a list of components encapsulated within the model (e.g. compartments, species, parameters, reactions, etc.). However, SBML is difficult to read, comprehend and interpret by humans directly, and tools are required to provide an abstraction layer to interact with SBML objects and the relationships between them. The objective of the project SBML4Humans is to address this issue by providing  an interactive and reactive report for SBML models which will allow humans (experts as well as beginners) to easily comprehend the content of a model. The key features introduced in the interactive report are:</p>

CD models involve the analysis of flows from an origin to a destination similarly to traditional SI models, however, CD includes the ‘Competing Destination’ term also known as ‘Accessibility’ term, which accounts for the spatial-structure effect of the flows from behavioural perspective.
Although the SI models are established within Python and R modules already (SpInt, simR),  specification for deriving Accessibility term for CD estimation is missing. 
This project aims to fill this gap by developing a Competing Destination class that will include the computation of the accessibility term and will be binded to the existing SpInt module. The main challenge here is the scaling of the accessibility computation for large datasets. This is an important aspect of the project as flow datasets often have hundred thousands and even millions records.
This project will extend the use of the SpInt module and PySAL library for high level analysis of spatial flows.</p>

PyMC3 has about seven time-series distributions, an important class of models in Probabilistic Programming. This project works on extending this class in a few ways: Firstly, the addition of a new model - namely Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA). Expansion of the existing distributions(and their respective documentation), including Time-Series analysis functions. Thirdly, state-space implementation of possibly a time-varying linear and Gaussian time series model, based on Aesara. Additionally, I believe that Programming can be an efficient way of understanding applied mathematics, motivating me to focus on more pedagogical or explanatory notebooks about Probabilistic Programming (Time-Series in this case). Explanatory Notebooks for ARIMA and state-space model usage, exploring their Econometric applications will be a small step towards fostering an interdisciplinary bond between academia and the open-source community, mutually benefiting both.</p>

If we can ""Gaussianize"" data from such processes in a meaningful way, then we can make better inferences.  We can solve this problem generally by applying a Lambert W transform (Goerg, 2014), which assumes the observed data is distributed as Lambert W x F_X, where F_X is the distribution of the latent input (Goerg , 2011). To apply this transform, we need to estimate parameters of the Lambert W x F_X distribution and also support the inverse transform, so that we can make inferences about the latent input. With this project, we want to support Lambert W x F_X distribution in Stan in an inferential setting, which means: users can build Gaussian models over non-normal data in a transparent way.</p>

One such astronomical data storage format is the CDS-ASCII format employed by Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) for maintaining its VizieR catalog. Currently Astropy only supports reading data from a CDS-ASCII table and not writing to it. The present project is meant to address this issue by adding a CDS-ASCII writer to Astropy.

A common approach for characterizing the properties of time-series data is to estimate the power spectrum of the data using the periodogram. But the periodogram as an estimate suffers from being:</p>

It uses a line-by-line approach, where each absorption or emission line of a molecule is computed by accounting for the influence of environmental parameters. Even though the current implementation can compute high-temperature spectra of millions of lines in just a few seconds it is quite memory hungry. In order to be able to run computations on high-temperature infrared spectra from databases of tens of millions of lines, it is essential to optimize memory consumption in a way that it is possible for us to run reasonably large data on a regular machine (one that has 8 - 16 GB of RAM). RADIS uses Pandas dataframe for handling all the databases currently. Pandas rule of thumb: have 5 to 10 times as much RAM as the size of the dataset. Which makes it impossible to read say a database of size 5GB on a machine with a RAM of 16GB. The goal of this project would be to reduce the memory usage of the current calculations, which would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines.</p>

While Pytorch implements many deep learning models, it doesn't implement many machine learning algorithms like SVM and Random forest. <strong>This limits users of Syft in terms of using variety of algorithms to train models on remote data.</strong> Scikit-learn provides many simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis and is very popular and is used vastly in the Data-Scientist community. <strong>This project aims to integrate Scikit-learn into Syft's infrastructure to allow users of Syft to use all end-to-end algorithms and features which Scikit-learn provides.</strong></p>

The software uses its own database schema which differs from the one used by the main OSM database. As a result, Nominatim processes OSM data in a way that allows to discover a lot of inconsistencies. The idea of the project is to build a Quality Assurance tool which will analyze the Nominatim database and extract the data errors to multiple formatted JSON files. The errors will be extracted based on a set of rules defined inside the tool. At first, the exported JSON files would be used to present all the errors data to OSM mappers through a visual map on a website. Thus, this tool will help OSM mappers to correct wrong data by taking advantage of the Nominatim internal data structure. The tool should be designed in a way that allows to add new rules easily. In the future, it should also be possible to extract the reports in some other formats in a flexible way. The process would be run once per day against the Nominatim database, stopping regular updates during its execution, so it is crucial that it is optimized to run fast.</p>

<h4>Other Goals</h4>
<p>Improve the UI usability for IBus in GNOME. That is, to add more features, including customization of orientation, animation, font, opacity. Support right-click to switch the input source or open the tray menu, scroll to switch among pages or candidates, fix candidate box and IME switch list order,  ASCII mode auto-switch, reposition, show or hide candidate box page buttons, set system tray settings, input source indicator with settings. Theme and background picture follow GNOME Night Light Mode, and so on. These customizations will make users find IBus in GNOME familiar if they have just switched from another platform. Eventually, an extension providing full customization of appearance, behavior, system tray, input source indicator for IBus will be available.</p>

<p>Oppia Android's current testing corpus includes unit tests using the Robolectric testing framework &amp; integration tests using the Espresso testing framework (to ensure that the app operates as expected in a real Android environment). The current tests have a few limitations: they do not correctly facilitate cross-activity navigation flows which actual users will be triggering, and they do not verify that the app can interact with Oppia's backend correctly.</p>
<p>To prepare for the global launch of the app, we need end-to-end tests that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that the app works as a user would expect by playing through select critical user journeys</li>
<li>Verify that the app operates as expected when interacting with a local developer instance of the Oppia backend server</li>

The issue is that a lot of the vulnerability testing modules have not been updated for a long time and have stopped working. The project has become unstable due to the lesser number of contributions.<br>
Hence, I want to help stabilize the project and add a few much-needed features.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the same, I would be working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding the custom Test groups feature to the system.</li>
<li>Fixing the framework freezing issue which happens due to the synchronous connection with the database.</li>
<li>Implementing a celery worker for remote plugin processing </li>

The users are provided with the ability to not only exploit the vulnerability, but visualize the underlying source of the security issue and attempt to fix it. This fixing feature verifies the user solution for inconsistencies in syntax, and after proving that the service won’t be crashed by the changes, run the newly modified version overriding the original one. In this way we enable the user to dynamically test for the secure code fragment that fixes the root cause of the issue exemplified in the lab.</p>

<p>With this proposal, I intend to shed light on the various areas which can be improved to better the user experience of DefectDojo. The application currently solves a very important problem which falls under resource/project management and as it stands, management can get overwhelming at times. The user application that aims to solve this problem should be more responsive and smooth, in terms of usability, intuitiveness and the value it brings to the end user. In this proposal, I continue to explain how various screens can be made more intuitive as well as faster and more responsive through the use of modern JS libraries and frameworks which have been adopted heavily by the industry such as the React Framework. As explained further, the framework aids in preventing from reinventing the wheel and focusing on features and challenges more worthy of the development time.</p>

This means that the code changes frequently and there are a lot of branches and commits. When big changes are made, performance has to be tested.</p>
<p>Performance Farm is a program that can be used to collect and visualize the benchmark results while the 
source code changes. Developers can analyze the performance of different versions of the source code or the efficacy on different operating systems.</p>
<p>It is built with Python scripts, a Django REST API server, and a front-end website. The actual benchmarks can be run on Linux and macOS machines while the users can easily see the results using the website.</p>

One example of this is the ability to write user-defined functions in other languages besides SQL and C.</p>
<p>Julia is still a new language but with a growing community and increasing popularity due to its several strong points, among which are the Python-like straightforward syntax, speed, and interoperability with other languages.</p>
<p>Of course, Julia is nowhere near as established as Python (for which the PL extension is included in the standard releases of Postgresql). Still, as it becomes more widely adopted, I think that adding a more functional pl/Julia to the list of pl handlers available to developers will soon be seen as a useful contribution to the community.</p>

<p>Since, cve-bin-tool relies on contributors to build checkers for each package. This in turn requires them to know various file manipulation methods, which are easier to use on linux than on windows. To simplify this process, I propose to create a checker creation helper script, which would take .rpm, .deb, .tar.gz or other files that represent packaged versions of the software to be detected, including the product name and version number that we expect to find in each as a set of inputs.
The script would automate the process mentioned in the <a href=""https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/cve_bin_tool/checkers/README.md"" target=""_blank"">checkers/readme.md</a></p>
<p><strong>Recommending Safe Package Versions</strong> -
Currently, cve-bin-tool outputs the vulnerable package name, version and vendor-product name. An upgrade to this would be to also provide the user with the list of all safe/fixed packages for the corresponding vulnerable packages found while scanning.
This could be done by taking a vulnerable package (which was found in the scan) and web-scraping for the latest vulnerable version and then comparing it with all it’s released versions and then giving the safe version as output. An extended goal to this could be to automate the final downloading process.</p>

Hub is a package that stores petabyte-scale datasets as a single numpy-like array on the cloud, so one can seamlessly access and work with it from any machine. Hub has a simple API that enables its users to obtain a lot of functionality with just a few lines of code. However, as a complete beginner, it is difficult for many to learn the nuances of a new package. Reading the documentation is something that helps, but it is not exactly a fun way of learning something new. It can become tedious and boring. This is exactly why it would be great if Hub had a package that interactively teaches the basics of hub in the CLI itself.</p>

MIME stands for “Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.” This method is used to examine the type of content in a web request or response to determining the content’s format. Usually, we can determine a resource’s MIME type by looking at the Content-Type response header in an HTTP response but some developers set values for Content-Type headers that are not suitable for the response’s content. This is where MIME Sniffing comes into play to determine the actual MIME type by analyzing the response’s content.</p>
<p>Misinterpreting MIME types can cause bugs while using Scrapy frameworks in projects. Therefore, we should implement the python library that can handle all the MIME sniffing standards.

It has been used by CERN in its ROOT project and an R interface called Runuran also exists. It will be a very nice addition to scipy.stats.

The implementation in SciPy is too slow to be relied on for practical purposes and custom methods for sampling random variates need to be implemented for the distributions in SciPy.

These recordings are also used to learn about normal brain function under various experimental conditions. The first step in analyzing intracranial electrophysiology recordings is determining the location of the electrode contacts in the coordinate frame of a subject’s T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI). The subject must also have a computed tomography (CT) image taken during or after the implantation surgery. The pre-surgical MRI has better resolution of the brain anatomy than the CT, whereas the CT shows the positions of the electrode contacts. These two 3D images allow the location of the electrode contacts to be associated with anatomical brain structures. MNE-Python has existing tools for analyzing time series data recorded by intracranial electrode contacts but there is a gap in the functionality in being able to label the location of intracranial electrode contacts. The proposed project is to add a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to localize electrode contacts as an enhancement to MNE-Python.</p>

divided by cuts. Film cuts can be broadly divided into two categories - Sharp/Hard cuts, Gradual cuts. This
work is about the detection and classification of these film cuts. While there are many algorithms for cut
detection, few of them yield a good performance efficiency ratio. In this work, a synthetic dataset has
also been made from scratch using appropriate algorithms. A method has been used in
which the hard cuts and gradual cuts are filtered and processed in different modules using different deep learning techniques. This approach should yield a descent performance and less computational complexity.
The proposed model is capable of detecting multiple cuts in a video and return timestamps of the cut
occurrence in the video. I have also proposed on making a flask webapp/ pyQT GUI to integrate this
model at the backend of the webapp or GUI. The webapp can be added to RedHenLab’s rapid annotator.</p>

The main problem is to find the correct anchor. For this, I want to propose a celeb detection API of Microsoft azure which is the best for this use case. Currently, the most time-consuming process in the program is going frame by frame and extracting faces. The face-recognition method used in the production code processes each frame individually. I want to upgrade it to a parallelized algorithm to process multiple frames in a batch and increase the processing speed exponentially, which will also help in faster testing of hyperparameters. Batch processing can be much quicker than processing single images at a time. So I think we use batch processing for multi-threading.</p>

This requires from us to have better understanding how videos are constructed. Videos are constructed by combining different shots of the camera placed after each other. A combination of different shot transition creates the final video at the end. The final video contain visual effects which could be classified into two main categories: sharp and gradual. The former is a sudden change of the shot over 1 frame, while gradual transitions occur over multiple frames. Gradual transitions are further classified into dissolve and non-dissolve. The former includes cases such as semi-transparent graduals, fade in and fade out. Non-dissolve are dominated by wipes. Wipe graduals have a much wider variety than the dissolve graduals.</p>

The research task is to detect hand gestures in raw news videos which are streams of RGB images.  I propose a Transformer and keypoints-based pose tracking system and a Transformer and keypoints-based gesture detector to fulfill this task. This structure is composed of a keypoints extractor, a person tracker, and a gesture detector. The mission has three main parts, the first part is to track people in temporal space. In the second part, for each person, we use their hand keypoints features in temporal space to construct several keypoints sequences. The third part is to use these sequences to make predictions of the existence of gestures. I believe that for gesture detection tasks, both spatial and temporal information is important. So that is why we use the Transformer which can take into account the local information of hand keypoints in one frame to capture the shape information and it values also the relationship of keypoints in different frames that is the global information refer to the motion.</p>

For example, Rizin loads sections information at the start. But it is common knowledge that section information can be manipulated without modifying the program execution. With this issue comes the fact that Rizin uses section information to deduct imported functions, strings and for other various analyses. Therefore, we need to make the section loading optional.

SNGNN-1D is one such Graph Neural Network based Machine Learning algorithm which evaluates the static scenes generated randomly from the point of view of the robot. In short, it outputs a score between 0-100 which shows how good the robot’s position is with respect to its surroundings. This score, for every state in the room, is used to generate a heat map that is used by A* algorithm to plan a path to the goal position. The problem with this implementation is that it is computationally expensive and is relatively slow, also SNGNN has been trained using static scenes and does not factor in dynamic settings for example, walking humans, which is a very common scenario in a social setting. A more cost effective way to carry out this task would be to train a policy to reach the goal. However, it is difficult to structure a reward function for complex environments.

AGM was designed on Python2, and now Robolab, the organization to which I am proposing this project, wants to port it to Python 3. These would be the main objective of this project, to port AGM from Python 2 to Python 3.</p>
<p>This objective requires two very different parts:</p>
<p>The first part is the port from Python 2 to Python 3 in itself. This means the changing of the code to adapt AGM to the new version of Python. However, this alone is not enough.</p>
<p>The second part is testing. Tests are required to check if the program is working as it is supposed to work. On programs like these, it is very important to run tests to assure that each part is ported correctly. If tests are not run, there is a risk that certain parts of the code not commonly used do not work correctly or return errors. In short, the objective of this part of the project is to effectively test the program to assure that the port is working correctly. Coverage is a part of this process too, so we also need to do it.</p>

For example, when A is the cohomology ring of a topological space X and G is a covering space action, A^G is the cohomology ring of the space X/G. I aim to implement a class for computation of A^G for a generic finite-dimensional A and group G.
Given a matroid M = (E,I), and a G-action on the ground set E, the Orlik-Terao algebra (OT(M)) and the Orlik-Solomon algebra (OS(M)) have a G-action induced by the action on E. Motivated by the mathematical definition of OT(M) and OS(M), I also intend to implement a class for ideals and quotients of graded supercommutative rings, using Groebner basis algorithms which are in the literature but not yet implemented in Sage.

The basic framework for this asymptotic ring is already implemented. The main aim of this summer of code project is to extend its functionality up to the point where asymptotic expressions with explicit constants are fully supported. In his book, “Asymptotic Methods in Analysis” on page 5, deBruijn calls it an “L-term”, but we will call it “B-term”. B_{20}(3z) is a B-term, which stands for an expression which is bounded in absolute value by
3|z| for |z| ≥ 20. Sometimes, in research, it is important to know from which values of the variable on the asymptotic expression has enough precision to decide wether it is larger than a given bound. This cannot be achieved by O-terms (because the unknown implicit constant might be very large). For example, the average number of comparisons of classical quicksort is 2n log n + O(n). When comparing with recent variants, such as dual pivot quicksort with average number of comparisons 1.8n log n + O(n), it is interesting to know how large the O-terms are in order to know when dual-pivot quicksort will be more efficient than classical quicksort.</p>

It turns out to be practical to denote it as an infinite series, although it does no longer represent a function.  However, the usual operations on power series, such as addition and multiplication, can be given combinatorial meaning, which makes them an indispensable tool in discrete mathematics. Lazy Formal Power Series are an implementation of the Formal Power Series for a computer where coefficients are only computed on-demand, to deal with the problem that we can store only a finite amount of information.
SageMath has an implementation of the Lazy Formal Power Series in the combinatorial species code. The project aims to disentangle the code from the unrequired submodules and create a robust structure. Another aim of the project is to implement Puiseux Series and bring in the implementation of the Laurent Series code into the same module. There are also bugs in the code that computes the coefficients of series which are defined implicitly by a system of functional equations.  Fixing these is another milestone. A detailed list of issues and tasks can be found in ticket #31651 on the Sage Trac server.</p>

Some SDKs are of no use as there are either definition files missing while some are not maintained.</p>
<p>Under this project, I aim to implement the important functionalities of the digital ocean in a suitable SDK(If not present), <strong>Implement a code generation module for that</strong> and then use that SDK to auto-generate classes, assembled as <strong>do-plugin</strong> for the <strong>Nodecloud integration</strong>.</p>

To run the simulation model, TARDIS requires some information such as velocity of shell structure, density, abundances, etc. These input parameters determine the composition of supernovae that the user wishes to explore.</p>
<p>At present, the model composition is initialized by a configuration YAML file or a CSVY format file and it is impractical to adjust the composition without the two files. Therefore, users have to edit text files manually in order to change the model composition, which tends to be inefficient and inconvenient for them. In this case, a custom abundance widget is proposed to provide a more convenient way in supernovae exploration. The project aims on abundance customization and allows the user to develop custom model compositions graphically, which can then also be output to a file.</p>

I propose a new component of the project - a connectors manager which would help connect IntelOwl with any external tool for be it enhancing the data it generates or performing automated analysis on the data it generates; or those which would facilitate the integration with other threat intelligence platforms.

<h5>Resilience</h5>
<p>For maintainability, it is necessary to deprecate Androguard, which is not a maintained library anymore, for Quark-Engine. Radare2 is an alternative tool recommended by the mentor and can replace all the functions of Androguard. The proposal aims at continuously improving the new core library until it is reliable enough to be used in Quark-Engine.</p>

<p>Quark-Engine consumes many resources when analyzing a big file due to the core library and the sequential computation. We found that replacing Androguard can solve the former issue. And introducing parallel computing solves the latter, too. As a result, I plan to make Quark-Engine parallel with the following improvement strategy.</p>

Today, rolling out a new model has become ever easier with the popularization of open-source frameworks such as scikit-learn and MLJ.

In an effort to automate the process of tweaking hyperparameters, MLJ has introduced a unified interface for tuning models, providing support for widely used strategies like grid and random search. The available schemes, however, primarily perform exhaustive testings on selected hyperparameter combinations. In this proposal, I present a plan to implement a new strategy, particle swarm optimization (PSO), which utilizes information from past attempts to improve hyperparameter search.

This enables performant, standardized graph  algorithms which are easily differentiable by modern auto-diff tools.

The SuiteSparse GraphBLAS (SS:GrB) implementation will be the primary target, and support for the several extensions to the specification in SS:GrB is also a goal. The primary application I am pursuing is an efficient implementation of graph machine learning in Julia, but it should be noted that graph computation and generalized sparse linear algebra have incredibly broad use cases including graph algorithms like breadth first search, and faster neural networks by taking advantage of sparsity and operators faster than typical multiplication.</p>

However, in their simplest form they scale notoriously poorly with large datasets.
There has been much work in recent years to develop approximate methods which enable GPs to be used with much larger datasets.</p>
<p>This project will focus on implementing such approximate methods for Gaussian processes within the JuliaGaussianProcesses ecosystem with the goal of achieving performance which is competitive with similar established Python packages (specifically GPFlow and GPyTorch).</p>

Hence PPLs usually come with built-in algorithms to perform Bayesian inference on such models automatically. However, due to the expressiveness of PPLs, it is very challenging to design general purpose inference algorithms for models specified in Turing-complete PPLs. Applications tend to build their own custom inference machines, which is time consuming and labour intensive. 
This proposal puts forward a recently introduced framework—the involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo (iMCMC), as a candidate for inference in a PPL, namely Turing. Such a framework would enable the automation of an implementation of a correct inference algorithm from user specifications in Turing. Moreover, Turing readily supports differentiable programming (in their HMC implementation) which is the main technical requirement of iMCMC. Early iMCMC developments in Gen show promising results compared to standard black box styled inferences. Hence, it would be desirable to have an implementation in Turing.</p>

This tool was initially released for Linux developers who send patches on mailing lists, but it can also be applied to other projects. To describe matching and transformation rules in the source code with a patch-like appearance, Coccinelle employs a domain specific language called the Semantic Patch Language (SmPL), and attempts to manipulate the given C code based on the given SmPL rule.  Although SmPL can provide many useful matching and transformation features, there are limits to the C matching patterns that the SmPL grammar can express due to the complexity of the C grammar. This is particularly the case for function headers, that involve complex types, annotations, etc that have been somewhat less tested by the users of Coccinelle. This project will study the current status and limitations of the handleability of function headers by designing and running a script that checks whether each function header in a given project can be parsed correctly and applying it to the latest Linux kernel. Based on the results, any detected problems will be fixed.</p>

Michael Sweet has deprecated the use of PPD files, but due to lack of replacement, we have continued using them. Some years ago the concept of printer applications as a replacement for the classic CUPS printer drivers was introduced. 
It solves many problems including no more use of obsolete PPD files and it enhances sandboxing. Printer applications themselves can be sandboxed, so they can be distributed as OS-distribution-independent packages on a central download place.
For this, all filter functions also need to work correctly even if there is no PPD file assigned to the print queue. They should as well understand standard IPP attributes as their options and printer IPP attributes for their default settings.</p>

Filters enable a user to print a file even if the printer does not support the file format. Currently some filters are in the form of standalone executables. This uses a lot of CPU resources for running printer applications due to so many calls for each individual executable. So the primary focus of this project is to convert a few filters (pdftoraster, texttopdf, bannertopdf) into filter functions. These functions would be integrated in a shared library so as to reduce the number of calls to individual filter executables and minimize CPU resources exploitation.</p>

It supports various high-level languages and hardware architectures. LLVM IR is an SSA-based intermediate representation whose design helps in the easy and efficient implementation of various compiler optimizations and transformations. 
Alive2 is a tool that checks whether the transformation of an instruction set into another instruction set is semantically correct or not. It is a verification framework for LLVM IR, which checks whether the source and target IR are equivalent or disproves by providing a counterexample. Alive2 can reason about a wide variety of intraprocedural optimization problems, including control flow, memory, vectors, and floating-point. Alive2 has detected some fundamental issues in the LLVM-IR, which lead to mis-compilation and unsound optimizations. In this project, I propose to solve some of these issues in the LLVM IR by making some changes to the LLVM compiler infrastructure code.</p>

This enables users to use Enzyme to perform various algorithms such as back-propagation in ML or scientific simulation on existing code for any language that lowers to LLVM. Enzyme does so by applying the chain rule to every instruction in every function called by the original function to be differentiated. While functional, this is not necessarily optimal for high-level matrix operations which may have algebraic properties for faster derivative computation. Many programs use BLAS libraries to efficiently compute matrix and tensor operations. This project would enable high-performance automatic differentiation of BLAS and similar libraries (such as Eigen) by specifying custom derivative rules for their operations.</p>

Due to the number of tests, it can take a long time to run the full suite, even on a high-spec computer. Builds are already distributable across multiple computers available on the same network, using software such as distcc or icecream, so running tests on a single machine becomes a potential bottleneck. One way to speed up running of the tests could be to distribute test execution across many computers too. Lit provides a test sharding mechanism, which allows multiple computers to run parts of the same testsuite in tandem, but this currently assumes access to a single common filesystem, which may not be possible in all cases and a knowledge of which machines the suite can currently be run on.</p>

It is difficult to determine whether an optimization is correct because bugs occur in corner cases and it’s hard to test them all for each optimization. But, thanks to Alive2, we can formally check the correctness of optimizations. Many of the bugs found are related to the notion of undef and poison values in LLVM. The semantics of these values has been formalized recently, and existing optimizations are being fixed to match the semantics. For example, branching on undef is now defined as undefined behavior (UB), and several branch-related optimizations are being fixed. However, fixing some of the optimizations requires further work, mainly due to performance concerns. One representative example is loop unswitch: it is incorrect, but still unfixed because fixing it causes big regressions in some benchmarks. Our goal is to fix such miscompilations with minimal-to-no performance regression. This project will investigate what is necessary to recover slowdowns and upstream the patches to LLVM.</p>

Enzyme is made as a plugin of LLVM and synthesizes differentiated functions directly on optimized LLVM IR code, which provides it with advantages in efficiency and universality. From another aspect, Rust is an emerging high-performance and safe language. Many of its users are trying to bring machine learning to it, thus an high-performance and user-friendly AD tool needed. Enzyme is a good option for this demand. However, without a deep integration into Rust, Enzyme's user experience with Rust is not so good, and more importantly, it may suffer from performance reduction due to wasted Rust meta-information. These problems hamper Enzyme from being widely used in Rust. This project will tackle the aforementioned problems through integrating Enzyme into Rust and then provide high-performance differentiation in Rust.</p>

Because financial data has outliers to various degrees, practitioners need robust estimates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are not strongly influenced by outliers,</li>
<li>Fit a good model to the bulk of the data,</li>
<li>Detect and ignore outliers, and</li>
<li>Provide for stable inference and prediction</li>

Consider the clinical trial design as an example. Optimizing the clinical trial design is essential to decrease the cost of drug development, as the average costs are up to 52.9 million US dollars for a Phase 3 trial [1]. The current approach formulates multi-stage decision-making as a general Linear Programming (LP) problem, which however, is computationally expensive especially in large-scale settings. In this project, we aim to develop new customized algorithms and an R package for multi-stage decision-making problems with three key features: 1) It provides a highly efficient solver to tackle a large and important class of sparse LP problems; 2) It provides a solution for multi-stage decision-making problems with Bayes risk constraints; 3) It provides additional functions such as visualization of the optimal decision maps.</p>

This project will focus on improving the implementation of critical subroutines, like batchsize() and mcse.q(), of the package. This would involve migrating to Rcpp, parallel implementation of functions and implementing alternate algorithms for the task. In addition, improvements to the existing implementation by correcting for numerical instabilities, Rcpp sugar implementations, solving for error or warning messages in corner cases, updating documentation and developing a class identifiable with the output form an integral part of the project.

Unfortunately, during my internship at ISP RAS my colleague Vitaly Cheptsov and I identified multiple defects in the current implementation of the EDK II PE/COFF loader. In consequence, I was tasked with implementing a more robust version of the library, ensuring reliability and security using formal methods. After the internship has concluded and our new loader has proven to be functional in many real-world scenarios, it is time to integrate it into the EDK II core, to increase the overall level of the firmware's reliability and security. The surrounding ecosystem should follow to take full advantage of the new code, including application of stricter memory permissions.</p>

The ease of use of its forerunning product, VLC Media Player, has made it the number one choice for millions of users around the world for viewing and interacting with media. Yet, despite this VLC Media Player’s design is relatively outdated. Features should be readily obvious to users, not hidden in multiple menus so that they can be accessed quickly and easily.</p>
<p>As an avid VLC Media Player fan, this forms the motivation behind my proposal. I propose to update VLC Media Player by leveraging Qt/QML to design a more modern and elegant interface. Specifically, I plan to redesign and implement a new welcome screen which is visible upon first opening of VLC Media Player. This includes the relevant Privacy and Metadata Consent passages for users as well as the ability to alter some commonly changed settings through an easily accessible modal.</p>

<p>Testing of software is important since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client, which guarantees the quality of the software. It makes the software more reliable and easy to use. Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software operation. Now to ease regression testing time and for better efficiency to validate complex scenarios automation is preffered.</p>
<p>The Major Goal</p>
<p>Currently mediawiki is using Webdriverio as a browser driver for our test automation framework which is at version 6 (exception: 2 are at V4). The goal of this project is to migrate them to version 7 (Latest) Which was released recently on Feb 9 , 2021. Also we need to perform cleanup and refactoring of the existing WebdriverIO code across all repositories. (Additional goals below).</p>
<p>Features in new updates</p>
<p>Stricter Protocol Compilance
Test Coverage Reporting
Dropped Node v10 support
Improved google lighthouse Integration</p>
<p>The Additional Goals:</p>
<p>Enabling of video recording in all selenium test

In this pursuit, there is now a need for a new technical infrastructure to help scale these solutions even further. The current system, ORES has been enabling ML at the foundation for ~6 years. The proposed infrastructure, Lift Wing aims to enable more widespread participation and collaboration with volunteers and communities by lowering the bar to contribute models to the system.</p>
<p>The goal of this project will be to train ML models that perform equivalent or better than the existing models without using revscoring and the ORES infrastructure.The goal is to  achieve equivalent or better performance on the same task given the original data used to train the models and ensuring that all the libraries they use are open-source and industry standard (e.g tensorflow, pytorch, scikit learn, hugging face, etc) with the exception of mwparserfromhell which is required to parse the wikitext that is included in the data.</p>

There are two types of installations currently present for XWiki - Testing one and Production one. Also, there are two major versions available currently: 12.10.5 - the stable release and 13.2 - the active latest release. Cloud computing has gained significant recognition in the past few years due to the availability of a virtually unlimited number of servers and unlimited power/memory availability within seconds while maintaining a pay-per-use model for billing. As companies and users move to Cloud-based solutions for their server needs, it makes sense that XWiki too should integrate seamlessly with major cloud provider solutions. Currently, Amazon’s AWS has the greatest market share in the Cloud Market, which is greater than the combined market share of Google (GCP) and Microsoft (Azure). Therefore we need to provide AMIs and Cloudformation Templates (in the context of AWS), which end users can consume directly to spin up XWiki within minutes and start testing/working.</p>

<p>The restrictive nature of a terminal application makes it all the more challenging and interesting to work on. Making ZT intuitive for every kind of person, <em>""techy""</em> or not, is the general vision of my project. This project mainly focuses on improving:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message Rendering</strong> capabilities <em>(Syntax Highlighting, Display Emojis)</em></li>
<li>general <strong>UI Navigability</strong> and <strong>Usability</strong> <em>(Dynamic Layout, Tabs, Focus Highlighting, SearchBox)</em></li>
<li><strong>Internal Refactors</strong> for better code management <em>(Themes, Buttons &amp; Panels , Keypress)</em></li>
<li>certain <strong>Event Handling</strong> functions <em>(Typing Notification)</em></li>
<li>and some <strong>Bugfixes</strong>.</li>

Major tasks include modifying the framework and testing to allow generating API pages directly from OpenAPI data and removing the redundant templates, and adding support for auto-generated API bindings by integrating different tools into the framework.<br>
The docs will also be visually enhanced by improving the organisation and UI of /register and /events endpoints, and /api pages in general. This would include major design changes to the documentation pages to improve the overall user experience. Further, the OpenAPI data for currently undocumented /api endpoints will be added to improve the endpoint coverage by the docs.<br>
This project would also involve fixing the currently open issues related to API Docs area, majority of which improve the testing of OpenAPI data, as well as making various API migrations with appropriate updates in OpenAPI data. Also, improvements would be made to the organisation of OpenAPI data and its testing/error messages to make it easier to maintain and work with.</p>

<p>Zulip uses two different markdown processors: for the backend, it is <a href=""https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown"" target=""_blank"">Python-Markdown</a> and for the frontend, it is <a href=""https://github.com/markedjs/marked"" target=""_blank"">marked.js</a>.</p>
<p>While the backend markdown processor is highly extensible but the current frontend markdown processor doesn’t allow the same. Moreover, it is not upgradeable because of the Zulip customisations.</p>
<p>The goals of this project are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refactor the frontend-markdown processor with CommonMark parser.</li>
<li>Make the same extensible for Zulip’s custom features like @-mentions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll take the reference from <a href=""https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js"" target=""_blank"">commonmark.js</a> to write the CommonMark parser for our frontend-markdown processor. And to make it extensible, I'll use the upstream <a href=""https://github.com/markedjs/marked"" target=""_blank"">marked.js</a>.</p>
<p>In parallel to this, I’ll focus on works in the markdown area. Integrating them with the Zulip will help to increase the overall users’ experience. The list of them are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/17971"" target=""_blank"">Add support for link shortener</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/2401"" target=""_blank"">Re-enable backslash escape inline pattern</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/2183"" target=""_blank"">Add support for online mentions</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13746"" target=""_blank"">Add support for importing avatar from GitHub on account creation</a></li>
