The current implementation relies on a custom interface, limiting exposure to standard ROS 2 practices. By transitioning exercises like Follow Line and Basic Vacuum Cleaner to use native ROS 2 nodes, topics, publishers, and subscribers, users will gain hands-on experience with real-world ROS development patterns. The project will also ensure compatibility with ROS 2 tools like rqt_graph, ros2 topic echo, and rviz2 for debugging and visualization.

Deliverables include:
 - ROS 2-native versions of two exercises (Follow Line and Basic Vacuum Cleaner)
 - Removal of HAL dependencies
 - Integration with standard ROS 2 tools and practices
 - Documentation and examples to help users build, debug, and run their solutions 
    using native ROS 2

This project aims to enhance the brainglobe-registration tool by automating the selection of atlas regions for aligning 2D or 3D brain images to a standard anatomical reference via brainglobe-atlasapi. Currently, this process is manual, time-consuming, and subjective, posing a barrier to reproducibility and efficiency. By introducing a new preprocessing step that automatically identifies the optimal atlas region – using methods such as adaptive grid search, machine learning, or Bayesian optimisation – this project will streamline the workflow and improve accuracy. Deliverables include at least two implemented approaches, benchmarking, comprehensive testing, full documentation, and a blog post to showcase the new functionality.

This automation directly benefits my research in paediatric radiotherapy, where mapping histology images to an atlas is essential for analysing cellular behaviour across brain regions. By making this process faster and more robust, it not only enhances my own work but also enables broader adoption of BrainGlobe tools by researchers in neuroscience and healthcare, even those without extensive anatomical expertise.

Minimal Set of Deliverables:

•	Implement a new preprocessing step to automatically select the atlas region.
•	Compare at least two region-selection methods (e.g., adaptive grid search vs ML/Bayesian optimisation).
•	Add tests to validate the new functionality.
•	Document the new pipeline and add usage instructions.
•	Write a blog post showcasing the project and results.",Saarah Hussain,https://gist.github.com/saarah815/61269e705ddd3641f55f48eba5f90a6f,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/7Xk4Fl7t

A thorough benchmarking framework is also included in the project to gauge cost effectiveness and performance gains. 

Four stages make up the 175-hour schedule: preliminary setup and research, core cloud access mechanism implementation, performance benchmarking and optimization, and thorough documentation. The implementation of a cloud-aware PyTorch dataset, an adaptive prefetcher, and optimized chunk configuration based on access patterns are important technical advancements.

Furthermore, sampling requires boundary conditions, such as zero, extend, or wrap. Currently, these conditions are not exposed to the user, but use the wrap condition across different sampling methods. The conditions should also be selectable in the node giving more freedom to the users.

Lastly, there is one sampling method that requires some special attention – BLI_ewa_filter. 
Currently, the EWA sampling uses different implementations across CPU and GPU, leading to different results on different devices/OSs.

So, data on specific populations are necessary to perform such research. However, faced with vast and complex healthcare data, traditional data analysis and processing methods prove to be inadequate.For example, cohort discovery is a popular existing tool that can allow researchers to safely explore the data in the Research Data Warehouse (RDW) prior to making a data request. But in real-world scenarios, the cohort discovery tool is not easy to use because users need to get familiarized with the workflow of the tool and it may even acquire them to write complex query languages, such as SQL.

We also observe this inconvenience with the existing cohort discovery tool in
D4CG, an open-source organization of the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons. As it works on building communities, platforms and becoming the critical data source for researchers and organizations, it has become evident that implementing an efficient cohort discovery tool would significantly enhance Research and Development (R&D) efficiency.

With the rapid growth power of Large Language Models (LLM), this project
proposes an innovative solution to enhance the cohort discovery tool by developing a query agent based on LLM to achieve more flexible and efficient data analysis and processing. To prototype this query agent, this project focuses on refining natural language understanding (NLU), improving query accuracy, supporting more complex filters, and integrating feedback mechanisms to learn from user interactions. For example, Given a user question like “Can you help me find patients aged between 20 and 40 who have a history of toothache in the Clinic Table?”, the query agent takes the question along with the corresponding database schema as input. It then generates a query output that satisfies the user’s request.",Regina Huang,https://github.com/chicagopcdc/GSoC-Cohort-Discovery-Chatbot,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/tZzV2cMH

The objective of this project is to implement the Micali-Vazirani algorithm in SageMath — which achieves the best known theoretical runtime of O(|E|⋅√|V|) for computing such a matching — and to make all of this available freely to students, educators as well as researchers all across the world.",Janmenjaya Panda,https://janmenjayap.github.io/GSoC-2025/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/0BAiIfUe

The performance relies heavily on a few core linear algebra operations, so care must be taken to use the most efficient implementations and to exploit any additional characteristics of the specific use cases. Consideration may also be given to more general optimisation of methods for matrices over univariate polynomials.

Key goals for the project are to have the above functionalities implemented efficiently, with accompanying documentation and tests to meet the project standards.",Nicholas Bell,https://gist.github.com/Biffo89/af96850071fd0212ac64b6ba7b03698e,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/BUMbi6Vs

of them is faster than others depending on an input graph or the amount
of memory used. The goal of this project is to implement a unified function

While Neovim can provide some AI capabilities, current APIs are not convenient enough for handling complex tasks like streaming results or customizing AI interactions.

To solve this, the proposal focuses on three main areas:

1. Enhanced LSP Support: Adding support for AI-related methods such as `textDocument/inlineCompletion` and improving LSP's handling of partial results with `PartialResultParam`.
2. Progress Interface: Introducing a built-in progress interface (`vim.ui.progress`) to track and display long-running tasks, improving user experience during AI interactions.
3. Prompt Buffer Improvements: Creating a new Lua API for multi-line and editable prompt buffers to facilitate interactive AI chats or REPL-like environments.

By addressing these areas, this project will provide a foundation for integrating AI into Neovim while offering general usability and extensibility improvements for all users.",Yi Ming,https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/34254,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/7Q85JtxY

While Kubernetes has recently introduced checkpointing support, it lacks a proper synchronization mechanism for distributed workloads, especially in managing network state during checkpoint and restore.

To solve this, the project proposes to extend the existing criu-coordinator tool with support for network connection management via CRIU’s hook mechanisms.

The project leverages recent upstream additions to glibc and Linux kernel that enable GCS support in user space, using Yocto and Arm's Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) to emulate and test the architecture-specific functionality. This is a first step in exploring how CRIU might need to change to handle GCS systems, starting with test coverage

Project Deliverables 
June 2 (coding begins) - GCS-enabled Environment Verified. Yocto + FVP setup is confirmed working. Compiling and running GCS-marked binaries with glibc tunables active.
July 12-16 (Midterm Evaluation) - First GCS ZDTM test added. A basic test that reads verifies TPIDR2_EL0, and explores stack/register consistency across the restore boundary. Integration with --nocr working. Investigation of parasite.c and restorer.c to identify the point at which TLS or control state (e.g., TPIDR2_EL0) could be saved or restored.
August 16-August 23 (Final Evaluation) - Full round-trip test of checkpointing and restoring a GCS-using process. All tunables, toolchain flags, and kernel glibc dependencies documented.
August 31 (Final Results Announced) - Final cleanup and documentation. Tutorial-style instructions provided on how to replicate setup, test flow, and next steps.

Each planted tree is minted as an NFT (ERC-721), storing critical metadata like geolocation, species, and planter details on-chain. To ensure authenticity, the system incorporates a community-driven verification mechanism where users can validate trees by submitting photo proofs stored on IPFS, earning tokenized rewards (ERC-20) for their participation. A key innovation is the use of geohash-based indexing, which optimizes location queries by dynamically adjusting precision based on map zoom levels, significantly reducing gas costs and improving performance. The app features an interactive map built with Flutter, displaying nearby trees with species-specific icons and enabling users to explore detailed records.

To address the issue of tree mortality, the project introduces legacy tokens—ERC-20 rewards distributed to planters who report deceased trees or submit maintenance updates like care photos and videos. Tree NFTs are transferable, with ancestry tracked to maintain historical records. For collective efforts, smart contract-based organizational tools allow groups to manage plantations, add members, and track contributions on-chain. Additionally, each tree is linked to a dynamic QR code stored on IPFS, enabling physical trees to be scanned for instant access to their digital records. By combining blockchain transparency, geospatial efficiency, and community incentives, this project establishes a scalable and trustless framework for global reforestation efforts.",Aaryan Jain,https://gist.github.com/IronJam11/ad4c0298f77c30300baf03fcddb5e441,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/7LicPpJH

1. Updating the codebase to support 1:1 DMs using DirectMessageGroup.
2. Running a backfill migration to create a DirectMessageGroup for each user pair with existing 1:1 messages.

decoupling their configuration dialogs from their underlying logic. This change will
allow us to remove the inclusion of heavy QtWidgets header files, which currently
lead to unnecessary memory usage. Reducing this overhead is essential for making
the Merkuro suite fully usable on mobile devices, where resource constraints are
critical.
At present, many components load their GUI elements by default, unnecessarily
increasing the memory footprint and hindering performance on resource-constrained
platforms. By refactoring these configuration dialogs into separate, dynamically
loaded plugins, the agents and resources can run leaner and more efficiently (it
would save around 15-20 Mib of RAM per agent/resource) while still providing
full-featured configuration interfaces when needed by host applications.
Project Deliverables
● Refactor as many as reasonably possible of the selected Akonadi agents
and resources within the GSoC timeframe. The goal is not necessarily to port
all agents, but to make meaningful progress and establish a repeatable
pattern for others to follow, ensuring the project is successful even if not every
target is completed.
● Eliminate embedded QtWidgets dependencies—such as replacing
QApplication with QCoreApplication—in their primary functionality.
● Identify and replace additional usages of QtWidgets beyond the configuration
dialogs—such as QMessageBox instances used to show error messages.
● Modify build configurations (CMake files) to strip out unnecessary UI files and
reduce dependencies, thereby lowering memory usage.
● Create dedicated configuration plugins that encapsulate the GUI functionality
previously embedded within agents and resources.
● Test and document all changes to verify that memory usage is indeed reduced
and that the new plugin-based configuration system functions correctly across
both desktop and mobile environments.",Pabarino,https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2025/StatusReports/PabloAri%C3%B1o,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/0Qcb864C

Currently, to feed text into models like GPT-2 or GPT-3, users must rely on external libraries (e.g. tiktoken) for tokenization. My project will create a built-in tokenizer utility—implemented in C++ with Python bindings—that can convert raw text into token IDs and decode model outputs back into text.  

The core deliverable is a new cv::dnn::Tokenizer class supporting Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), along with the ability to load typical vocabulary/merges files and handle special tokens. Once implemented, this will allow a seamless pipeline for text-based or multimodal models within OpenCV: raw text -> tokens -> DNN inference -> tokens -> decoded text. I will also write comprehensive documentation and test this functionality against known tokenizer outputs (e.g., Hugging Face), ensuring correctness and good performance.  

By adding native tokenization, OpenCV’s DNN module becomes more versatile for cutting-edge AI tasks involving both vision and language. This reduces external dependencies, makes it easier to deploy LLMs in pure C++ or Python environments, and helps unify image and text processing in a single library—further strengthening OpenCV as a comprehensive open-source toolkit.",Jorge Velez,https://gist.github.com/JorgeV92/c056783926c66b3e57f4d7fe0d4ec967,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/79SW6eNK

Based on the conversation in opencv-gsoc-202X mailing list, the main prioritized algorithms are:

    Smarter white balance algorithms
    Color corrections
    vignetting correction, chromatic aberration correction
    Exposure, contrast, temperature correction and enhancement in color images

In my proposal, I outline some possible algorithms that would in the beginning be implemented for opencv_contrib and could be migrated to opencv, mostly in the photo module. In particular, in order of approximate importance:

    Auto white balance: implement FFCC
    Chromatic aberration correction: implement algorithm of Chang et al.
    Denoising: implement a CNN-based method as a module like dnn_superres
    Exposure correction: implement (Adaptive, Weighted) Gamma Correction
    Superresolution: check if any additional newer models for superresolution could be added

If I am accepted as a contributor in GSOC, I expect to pursue 2-3 of these topics in-depth to fit in the timeframe of the medium-sized project (~175 hours).

It makes use of existing biodiversity datasets (OBIS, GBIF) and ecosystem variables (e.g., temperature) to develop a collection of reproducible Jupyter Notebooks powered by Python packages like pyOBIS, GeoPandas, and machine learning packages. These notebooks are dedicated to showcasing the top environmental inquiries in areas like the Florida Keys, Rookery Bay, Tampa Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico covering trends in Rice's Whale, birds, and seagrasses.

The solution combines species occurrence records and ecosystem information to generate visualizations, spatial models, and biodiversity metrics. Interactive maps, temporal trend plots, and model-based habitat predictions are products. Constructed with reproducibility and open science principles in mind, the tools will assist resource managers, researchers, and decision-makers in conservation planning.

Deliverables include:

 5 modular Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., habitat models, trend predictions),
 Reusable data pipeline functions (data ingestion, cleaning, analysis),
 Public Docker-supported GitHub repository,
Easy-to-read documentation and automated testing framework.

However, its current workflow, particularly the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) processing and JIGSAW mesh generation steps, remains highly time-consuming and not well-optimized for High Performance Computing (HPC) environments.
To address this bottleneck, I propose introducing parallelism into the most computationally intensive stages of the workflow: DEM processing and JIGSAW-based meshing. My approach involves leveraging parallel computing libraries such as Dask and mpi4py to scale these operations across multiple cores and nodes.
For the preprocessing stage, several components are already optimized for single-node performance and can be extended to work efficiently in an HPC setting. Regarding JIGSAW meshing, I plan to implement a domain decomposition strategy, partitioning the domain into smaller subdomains that can be meshed independently in parallel. These subdomain meshes will then be seamlessly merged to form the final unified mesh.
This parallelized workflow is expected to dramatically reduce mesh generation time, enabling more scalable and efficient processing for large-scale ocean modeling tasks.

This approach will require less auditing, will enhance the build transparency and reduce the compile-time overhead.

Build scripts in Rust facilitate compiling and linking 3rd party code, such as existing C/C++ libraries, before building a package. They are immensely important for interoperability since it prevents replacing/rewriting the already existing tools that are well-optimized for their tasks. 

However, the current build system has certain limitations. Only one build script is allowed per package, and it must be run before building the package, often causing unnecessary computation (e.g., during unit tests). Single Large script needs extra auditing, increase compile-time, and reduce transparency for third-party build tools, especially while passing parameters. They also cannot run unit tests within themselves.

This project aims to overcome the above limitations by allowing multiple, well-organized build scripts that can be run directly from the Cargo.toml. These scripts are optional and run only when required, avoiding unnecessary expensive logic. With this, only the shared build scripts will need auditing. This approach enhances build transparency, reduces compile-time overhead, and even enables unit testing of build scripts if they are treated as a dedicated package.",Naman Garg ( namanlp ),https://gist.github.com/namanlp/90f96165d92f848b0452b34c68892a1c,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/nUt4PdAA

This ensures that major breaking changes do not occur without notice. However, the feedback from cargo-semver-checks is not always the easiest to understand, in that whatever problem may actually be present is not always obvious. Additionally, cargo-semver-checks sometimes suffers from false-positive, where it detects a breaking change where there is none. 

This project proposes to remedy many of these issues by leveraging the existing lint data to implement so-called ""witness programs"", which are designed to demonstrate the breaking change by compiling successfully on a baseline version of the crate being tested, but failing to compile on the new version, due to the error caused by the breaking change.

The plan is, following some research at the start, to implement a basic witness system that allows for additional internal queries and generation of a witness program from a template. Following that, implement automated testing of these witness programs to verify they do fail when expected. In the event of an unexpected behaviour, the system should be designed to provide the user with diagnostic information and an easy way to submit an issue to the cargo-semver-checks team. Lastly, these witness program templates then need to be written en masse, utilizing the now created system to provide these witness programs to as many lints as possible. Ideally, by the end of the Google Summer of Code program, 80% of the current lints should have witness program templates.

These experiments produce massive amounts of data that change over time, making it challenging to train machine learning models effectively.

Q-MAML uses quantum computing techniques with variational quantum circuits to enable ""few-shot learning."" This means the models can quickly adapt to new data with very little retraining, which is crucial for the dynamic environment of particle colliders. The goal is to improve tasks like identifying particle collision patterns (event topology classification) and finding rare signals.

The project will develop a modular, open-source Q-MAML workflow that is compatible with both quantum simulators and actual quantum hardware, utilizing platforms like Qiskit and PennyLane. The performance of Q-MAML will be rigorously benchmarked against classical MAML and standard variational quantum algorithm (VQA) classifiers on physics-inspired tasks. These benchmarks will include detailed evaluations of training curves, adaptation behaviors, and resource analysis. The deliverables will consist of a fully documented codebase, interactive Jupyter notebooks for ease of use, and reproducible benchmarking tools.

Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. While the calculation of amplitudes for a particular expression is trivial, mapping it to a squared amplitude is computationally expensive. Previous works demonstrated that transformer-based (vanilla and KAN-infused) models can map amplitudes to squared amplitudes substantially faster and with high accuracy. However, transformers suffer from quadratic complexity due to self-attention, making them less efficient when handling extremely long sequences. Additionally, they may struggle with structured, hierarchical dependencies that naturally arise in amplitude computations. Inspired by Classical State Space theory, State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modelling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of RNNs and CNNs. These models have near-linear scaling with sequence length, making them effective for long-range dependencies. This project will explore using SSMs for squared amplitude calculations.

The model architecture employed GraphSAGE layers and mincut pooling, while training used Adam optimizer with a hybrid loss function combining MSE and KL divergence.

However, the current approach is limited to single-layer detector responses and doesn't fully capture the correlations between multiple detector components.

Phase I will focus on enhancing the graph data representation by including all three detector layers and designing optimized connectivity patterns that capture spatial and inter-layer dependencies.

Phase II will explore advanced pooling techniques and alternative message-passing strategies to improve latent representation quality and model generalization, while maintaining fast inference speeds.

All components will be implemented using Python and relevant machine learning libraries such as PyTorch Geometric. Expected deliverables include a multi-layer GVAE model, benchmark comparisons against existing results, and detailed analysis of the architectural choices.

Diffusion models are characterized by a probability flow ODE equation which needs to solved using numerical solvers to generate samples from the target probability distribution. In this project we replace the numerical ODE solvers with PINNs which are trained to represent the solution of the probability flow ODEs over a domain of values. This enables us to amortize the large upfront cost of training PINN to fast sampling speed once the model is trained. 

Different variants of PINN like models with hard constrains on initial/boundary conditions, augmented Lagrangian based models, can-PINN and neural operator based methods will be systematically tested on different non Gaussian 3D probability distribution like [ Mixture of Gaussian, 3D helical, Torodial distribution and Concentric spherical shells ]. I will be testing both single objective optimization and  multi objective optimization techniques to handle the physical loss term and MSE loss term in PINN training. 

A systematic analysis of different variants of PINNs to solve the probability flow ODE will be presented with metrics to quantify the PINN representation error  and comparison between the true probability distribution and samples from PINNDE.

encodes the space-time symmetries present in collision events. By integrating
these complementary embeddings into task-specific cross-attention decoders, the

Subjects and objects are then strictly grounded to DBpedia URIs through Redis-backed entity linking, while predicates are retrieved via cosine similarity search over precomputed DBpedia ontology embeddings. A second LLM disambiguator refines these candidates, selecting the most contextually appropriate triple and generating structured metadata such as similarity scores and ranking.

Problem Statement:
The recently introduced Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric, integrated into the Core Web Vitals (CWV) system in 2024, aims at measuring user interaction performance. However, INP lacks granularity, making it difficult for developers to diagnose and address specific latency issues within different stages of event processing and rendering.

Solution Approach:
To enhance the diagnostic capabilities of INP, this proposal suggests breaking down the INP metric into its sub-dimensions—input delay, processing time, and presentation delay—by leveraging modifications to Chromium’s Event Timing API. These fine-grained timestamps will be transmitted from the Renderer process to the Browser process via Mojo IPC, eventually integrating these metrics into the UKM metric system and CrUX experimental dataset. The project will involve updating the PageLoadMetricsSender to include detailed timing data for each event, as well as enhancing the UkmPageLoadMetricsObserver to handle both old and new data formats seamlessly.

Deliverables:

1. Prototype Verification: Establish a proof-of-concept for collecting sub-dimension data using Chromium’s debugging environment.
2. Mojo Protocol Modification: Extend existing IPC interfaces to support new subpart timings.
3. UKM Integration: Implement new UKM metrics reporting and update relevant configurations.
4. Test Suite Development: Develop comprehensive tests including Web Platform Tests/WPT cases and unit test coverage.

These parameters cannot be measured directly and must be inferred from signal progression over time in techniques such as Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). The estimation is complicated by measurement noise, model ambiguity, and the sensitivity of parameter estimates to small variations in the data.
To improve robustness and accuracy, this project will implement a Bayesian framework that incorporates prior physiological knowledge and observed MRI signals to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters. For the pharmacokinetic modeling the Tofts model for DCE-MRI and perfusion modeling for ASL will be used. Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling and gradient-based optimization methods may improve the robustness of the reconstruction.

Flexible ASL (PyASL) introduces a redesigned, developer- and user-friendly architecture that makes advanced ASL analysis accessible to a wider scientific community. Key innovations include:
(1) Minimum programming knowledge required — run complete pipelines with more intuitive alternatives, such as YAML config, python notebook, command line interface, etc; 
(2) Mix & match preprocessing steps — combine algorithms from different pipelines without rewriting the code; 
(3) Easy plug-ins — add new preprocessing modules with minimal setup; 
(4) Support for integrating machine-learning models, custom statistics, and quality-control tools; 
(5) Extensibility beyond the brain to other organs, promoting cross-disciplinary imaging research.

This system can cut integration time for new models or analysis steps by 60–80%, reduce development overhead, and foster reproducibility and cross-functional collaboration among clinical and technical teams.

For example, the timing of a learning task relative to the cycle of the heartbeat modulates its event-related potential (ERP), and heart-beats interact with activity in the insula, an area critically involved in internal monitoring. However, despite this increased interest in BHI in the neuroscientific community, there is a lack of well-documented tool, that incorporates much of the modern BHI identification techniques, treats sensitively ECG artifacts, and furthermore complements modern brain connectivity analysis. BHI studies point to a much greater complexity in neural signals that current connectivity packages fail to account for, such as recent work pointing to the modulating of brain oscillations by respiration. As such, this project has two main purposes: extract BHI and direct respiratory modulation of the brain and build a brain connectivity tool that accounts for these confounding measures, built in the Python MNE environment to complement traditional data analysis pipelines. Our analysis functions will furthermore be validated through tutorial-like experiments, written as Jupyter notebooks on open datasets, and we hope that the results I show will convince the scientific audience of the importance of confounding peripheral measures in neural data.

However, due to bandwidth and storage limitations, only a fraction of the produced data can be stored. To ensure that CERN’s scientists can benefit from having as much data as possible, lossy compression techniques can be considered as a possible solution to CERN’s high data volume challenge. A promising contender in data compression techniques is “BALER,” a machine-learning-based compression tool under development by the particle physics divisions of the University of Manchester. Through the utilization of autoencoder neural networks, significant levels of compression while maintaining high accuracy have been achieved for a variety of datasets, including highly-dimensional LHC datasets and 2D images.

Leveraging my past experience with Tensorized Physics-Informed Neural Networks, I aim to integrate physical laws directly into the autoencoder architecture and loss function, ensuring that compressed representations maintain physical validity. Furthermore, comparing reconstructed data against the original collected data will highlight outliers and physical abnormalities.

The key goal is to learn generator-invariant representations from 4-momentum vectors of background events by pretraining the VAE using generator labels (e.g., Pythia, Herwig, Sherpa). The latent variables produced are then masked and enriched with high-level physics features (e.g., MET, HT, Meff) and passed through a transformer trained to reconstruct them, encouraging deeper physics representation learning.

The enhanced latent space is decoded using fine-tuning layers that perform multiple tasks simultaneously: reconstructing event-level features, predicting jet properties, and regressing unseen quantities. This structure encourages collaboration between the VAE and transformer components, increasing robustness against spurious correlations and improving anomaly detection performance.

My Solution:
By developing a JavaScript parser for RNTuple’s binary format, extending JSROOT’s interface to mirror its `TSelector` API for TTrees, and integrating visualization tools (histograms, scatter plots), researchers will gain seamless access to RNTuple data directly in web browsers. 

Key deliverables include:  

1. Validated Parser: Tested against ROOT-generated datasets (via C++ macros) for accuracy.  

2. JSROOT Integration: A `TRootupleSelector` interface enabling reuse of existing visualization modules.  

3. Interactive Visualizations: Histograms, scatter plots, and UI features (tooltips, zoom) for real-time data exploration.  

4. Optimized Performance: Stress-tested with 1M+ entries, cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

While lossless compression is already employed to manage this data, lossy compression—specifically of floating-point precision—offers more aggressive reductions, potentially decreasing file sizes by over 30%. However, this comes at the cost of irreversibly discarding information, raising the challenge of how to recover or approximate full-precision data for downstream analysis.

This project proposes a novel approach using deep probabilistic models to reconstruct high-precision floating-point data from aggressively compressed representations, a problem coined as precision upsampling. The goal is to explore and compare the capabilities of three classes of generative models: autoencoders, diffusion models, and normalizing flows. Each model type offers distinct advantages: autoencoders are well-studied in neural compression, diffusion models are robust to noise and excel in reconstructing multi-scale structures, and normalizing flows offer exact likelihood estimation and invertible mappings that align well with the structured nature of physical data.

Deliverables include a literature review on neural precision upsampling methods, a working baseline model adapted to CERN's PHYSLITE floating-point compressed data, and a comparative study of advanced probabilistic models—including variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and normalizing flows. Evaluation metrics will also be tailored to the data and implemented.

2. Incrementally migrating remaining AngularJS components and services to Angular, leveraging ngUpgrade within a hybrid architecture during the transition.   
3. Implementing modern Angular best practices, including modular architecture, dependency injection, and potentially lazy loading.   
4. Refactoring components using design patterns like Observer (RxJS), Facade, and Container-Presenter to improve structure and data handling.   
5. Ensuring UI consistency using ng-bootstrap.   
6. Establishing a robust testing strategy encompassing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like Jest and Cypress.   

Deliverables:
1. A fully migrated KomMonitor web client codebase, transitioned from AngularJS to Angular.   
2. Resolution of key AngularJS patterns ($rootScope, $compile) and conversion of necessary JavaScript files to TypeScript.   
3. Migrated and optimized components/services adhering to modern Angular standards and design patterns.   
4. A comprehensive test suite ensuring application stability and functionality post-migration.   
5. Updated documentation reflecting the migrated codebase.   
6. Final project code, documentation, and evaluation report.",goyalpranjal_,https://blog.52north.org/2025/09/23/kommonitor-breathing-new-life-into-an-open-source-gem/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/oiPd6sfN

While the classical DC is a powerful isosurfacing method, it may produce non-nonmanifold surfaces, leading to topological inconsistencies and computational challenges. Manifold dual contouring methods overcome this issue by introducing manifold constraints to ensure the generation of 2-manifold surfaces.

The project will begin with a detailed study of existing literature, including Manifold Dual Contouring by Schaefer, Ju and Warren, and other related methods. Based on the research, we will determine an algorithm that combines the most robust aspects of these methods. The next phase is to review current DC implementations in CGAL  to identify gaps that require modifications, particularly in routines such as the Quadratic Error Function (QEF) minimization, octree traversal, and polygonalization. Lastly, additional features will be added, including manifold criterions like the Euler characteristic test, and the support for multiple vertices per cell.

The final deliverables will be a robust implementation of the enhanced DC method integrated into CGAL under the Isosurfacing subroutine.

Unlike fixed or passive approaches, ACUMEN actively explores uncertain regions of physiological dynamics to accelerate learning. The goal was to build patient-specific models that can support adaptive therapies such as neuromodulation.

At its core, ACUMEN couples Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with Cross-Entropy Method Model Predictive Control (CEM-MPC). An ensemble of Neural ODEs serves as a surrogate model for continuous-time physiological signals. Ensemble disagreement quantifies epistemic uncertainty, which then drives exploration: CEM-MPC plans candidate interventions and prioritizes those that maximize model uncertainty, enhanced with optimistic rollouts, novelty-based objectives, and adaptive scaling. This iterative process collects the most informative data, retrains the ensemble, and progressively refines predictions.

Key Deliverables:

1- A simulation pipeline using the RL-DBS environment to generate realistic EEG-like signals and stimulation effects.
2- A dataset of stimulation–response pairs across clinically relevant ranges.
3- A trained Neural ODE ensemble surrogate model with documented accuracy and uncertainty metrics.
4- An uncertainty-driven RL environment with CEM-MPC–based exploration.
5- Evaluation showing up to 24.2% error reduction and tighter uncertainty bands compared to random data collection.
6- Open-source code, documentation, and final report.

Impact:

The policy ensures ABI stability between minor releases (e.g., 17.0 to 17.1) but allows changes in major versions. Currently, committers rely on manual reviews to enforce this, which occasionally leads to unintended ABI changes. A recent example occurred in PostgreSQL 17.1, where an ABI-breaking change was shipped and later reversed in 17.2. This incident highlights the need for an automated process to catch such issues before release. To enforce ABI stability, this project will monitor PostgreSQL’s repository across STABLE branches, detecting any ABI breakage early. Since ABI changes depend on system architecture, OS, and compiler, the tool will be developed as an extension to PostgreSQL Build Farm, leveraging its infrastructure to handle diverse configurations. Git receive hooks are unsuitable as PostgreSQL does not allow them due to repository performance concerns. As the frequency of commits on the PostgreSQL stable branches is very low, build farm’s cron based clients (animals) can simply compare the latest commit build(which it already does) with the latest release tag or the most recent minor release to get the ABI breakage, if any. The Libabigail suite (abidw, abidiff) will be used for ABI compliance checks, currently supporting GCC and Clang, with future expansion planned for other compilers.

Current solutions like PITR force restoration to a pre-accident state, losing valid changes made afterward. This project aims to enhance pgmoneta by adding advanced WAL filtering capabilities for targeted recovery, allowing users to preserve recent valid data while excluding specific operations, such as accidental DELETE queries or changes to certain tables. The proposed solution involves developing pgmoneta-walfilter, a command-line tool integrated into pgmoneta. This tool will enable users to define custom filtering rules in a YAML configuration file, processing WAL files from backups to omit unwanted operations during restoration. This enhancement will provide greater flexibility and control in recovery, while addressing the challenges of safely modifying WAL files to maintain data integrity.",Mohab Yasser,https://gist.github.com/Mohab96/e10af7b60d140caa1927a52c7fbdf8bf,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/ttqxjXNx

Second, the SV-COMP execution script is lacking proper property detection and result classification for runtime exception scenarios. To address these problems, we should extended SPF to have additional choices that will explore potential runtime exception scenarios when symbolic variables could represent values that can raise them.

Starting from a genome, these reconstructions are developed using annotations, biochemical data, and information from scientific literature. This can make GENREs strain-specific. From these networks, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are derived, serving as powerful tools for exploring bacterial systems. Biologically grounded constraints can be applied to these models, resulting in constraint-based models that can predict the flow of metabolites through a defined network with techniques such as Flux Balance Analysis, Flux Variability Analysis and Flux Sampling. So far, we have implemented several sampling approaches in our dingo Python library.  dingo-stats is a new Python library for the statistical analysis of flux sampling datasets. It works given any flux sampling dataset (in a desired format) and thus is not restricted only to dingo samples. Functions from dingo-stats are used for identifying and removing loopy reactions (as a quality control step) and estimating their effect on thermodynamic feasibility of the samples. Additionally users can extract pathway information from the KEGG database and compare different sampling datasets with differential flux and pathways enrichment analyses. Moreover, users can calculate pairwise linear correlations and non-linear dependencies using copulas between reaction flux distributions, perform clustering techniques to predict pathways/operons and evaluate their results with several clustering quality metrics and dimensionality reduction plots. Users can also create correlation-based graphs and proceed to analysis with measuring node (reaction) centrality metrics. With these metrics, information on reaction essentialities can be inferred.",Sotirios Touliopoulos,https://geomscale.github.io/GSoC2025-dingo/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/j6mlCS2r

We introduce ATIA, a novel evaluation suite designed to systematically assess the vulnerability of tool-calling agents to adversarial inputs. ATIA focuses on crafting malicious multimodal inputs—combinations of images, text, and other modalities—that covertly manipulate an agent's decision-making process regarding external tool invocations. By simulating a variety of attack vectors, including visual prompt injections, image–text conflicts, and spurious cross-modal cues, ATIA quantifies critical metrics such as tool call correctness, unsafe tool invocation rate, and adversarial success rate. This benchmark not only exposes potential weaknesses in current multimodal agent architectures but also provides actionable insights for developing robust, safe, and aligned systems.

There are 5 foundational types of AI agents that many AI agents can be classified as (Simple Reflex, Model-Based Reflex, Goal-Based, Utility-Based, and Learning Agents). Modern agentic workflows are built upon these foundational types or involve hybrids or multi-agent systems of these types. However, there is no existing benchmark that evaluates how LLMs perform generally as each agent type.  Existing AI agent benchmarks are very task-specific, meaning that those wanting to choose the right LLM for agentic tasks which have not yet been benchmarked need to rely on heuristics from similar task-specific data that is available. This novel benchmark aims to evaluate agent performance on various tasks specific to each agent type in order to gauge the generalized performance of LLMs as each specific agent type. Such a benchmark will not only be useful for developers for selecting the right LLM for their agent type but also for researchers to better understand the current agentic capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs. The benchmark will also help us learn which LLMs are more versatile or specialized in agentic settings.",Nattaput Namchittai,https://www.namchittai.com/gsoc2025,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/1E6DMVwi

First aid, navigation, shelter, and water skills reduce risk and help you protect others. That’s why I built Gemma Scout: an on-device, privacy-first AI assistant built for wilderness survival and outdoor adventures. Powered by a finetuned version of Gemma 3N, it combines domain-specific survival knowledge with real-time multimodal reasoning to guide users through critical tasks like plant identification, mushroom safety, shelter building, and first aid.

Leveraging Unsloth’s optimized finetuning framework with LoRA and quantization, Gemma Scout runs efficiently on mobile devices without internet access.

Using LLM evaluations, Gemma Scout outperformed its base model in survival QA by a win rate of 89%, and achieved over 36% improvement in mushroom classification and 47% in plant identification. It supports multimodal chat via llama.cpp mtmd and Swift integration, enabling users to send images and receive grounded, expert-level responses—completely serverless.

– Lightweight unit tests and clean vignettes
– Documentation of inputs, outputs, and assumptions
– A reproducible build setup that works across systems

This is especially true in quantum physics, where groundbreaking findings and complex concepts are emerging at a rapid pace, demanding constant attention and analysis from researchers. There is a dire need for AI that can efficiently process and summarize these vast volumes of scientific papers, helping human researchers focus their efforts on the most promising areas of investigation.

The problem of knowledge overload and the need for efficient systems to navigate and synthesize vast amounts of literature is not unique to quantum physics. In fact, it is a pervasive challenge across various academic and scientific disciplines, including statistics and data science – the very fields that led to the development of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models.

The exponential growth of research papers, coupled with the rapid advancement of statistical methodologies and data-driven approaches, has created a significant knowledge bottleneck in these domains. Researchers and practitioners in statistics and data science often struggle to keep up with the latest developments, hindering their ability to effectively leverage cutting-edge techniques and methodologies in their work. This knowledge overload problem has motivated the development of AI-powered systems like LLMs and RAG models, which aim to streamline the process of knowledge discovery, synthesis, and dissemination.

Benefits to the Community

- Improved Testing Framework: This project will enable LibreMesh developers to run “almost real” tests in a virtualized environment, improving debugging and validation before deploying changes to physical hardware.
- Enhanced Automation: By integrating virtual Wi-Fi support into QEMU, developers can automate complex test scenarios without requiring physical routers.
- A set of scripted tests that can be run on real hardware: Currently, real tests on physical hardware are performed manually at each release. With this new set of test scripts for QEMU and Wi-Fi, many tests will be automated and easily adapted to real hardware.
- Collaboration with OpenWrt: Given that OpenWrt is also working on virtual Wi-Fi support, this project can align efforts with the broader open-source networking community, benefiting multiple projects.

The core...,"This proposal aims to address the challenge of robust and accurate GPS-denied navigation for UAVs equipped with lightweight 3D cameras. The core problem is that while camera-based visual odometry can struggle in certain environments and LiDAR systems are often too heavy and expensive for all UAVs, there is not a reliable way for lightweight UAVs to leverage the high-accuracy 3D maps generated by more capable mapping systems.

The proposed solution is to develop a framework that allows UAVs with 3D cameras to utilize pre-generated, centimeter-level 3D maps for navigation. This will involve a C++ based ROS2 package designed to run on a companion computer. 

This package will:

1. Process the pre-generated maps.

2. Implement point‑cloud matching algorithms (such as ICP and NDT) to align live camera scans with the existing map and compute a 6‑DOF pose.

3. Fuse the estimated pose with IMU data using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide smooth, high‑rate odometry and improve Z‑axis estimation.

4. Incorporate a state machine to manage odometry data, perform sanity checks (e.g. data‑rate drops, connection loss, time desync, corrupted messages), and transmit the validated pose to the UAV’s firmware via MAVLink over serial.

The key deliverables of this project include:

1. A fully functional prototype in simulation capable of generating maps and producing 6‑DOF estimates with the 3D camera.

2. Algorithm design, implementation, and sensor fusion.

3. System integration, validation, and documentation.

4. A complete hardware setup.",Shubham-shahh,https://github.com/shubham-shahh/lidar_map_localizer/tree/v_0_3_Aug_2025,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/N3dE0FL7

The current MyUoM app for Greek universities is a central hub for students and faculty, but it's missing some key features. Right now, it lacks a solid login system, a scalable backend, and real-time updates from official university sources. Plus, there’s no easy way for other universities to customize or integrate the platform to fit their needs. This makes the app less flexible and limits its potential to be a truly unified solution for higher education in Greece.

Proposed Solution:

I’m proposing MyUni—a unified, open-source platform that fixes these headaches. Built with a modern MERN stack (Next.js, Express.js, MySQL), MyUni will offer a scalable backend, real-time data syncing via APIs, and a flexible CMS for announcements and updates. It’ll support multiple universities with customizable branding and layouts, all wrapped in a user-friendly interface. Using TypeScript, microservices, and tools like Nginx and Redis, I’ll ensure it’s fast, secure, and ready to grow.

Deliverables:

 By the end of GSoC 2025, I’ll deliver: 

- Web application that provide good user experience(UX) and has
good User Interface(UI).

- Admin dashboard where myuni admin can able to handle CMS and more.

- Student dashboard where student can able to take-care of their profile,
notifications of academics, and more.

- Backend Architecture which serves as solution to all project requirements.

- REST APIs with at least 95% test coverage.

- REST APIs with modern design patterns.

Currently, it includes a fixed tallying system for recording standard outputs, such as energy lost to ionization or defects. This project aims to extend OpenTRIM's capabilities by implementing a flexible, user-customizable tally system.

The new tally system will allow users to define, via JSON configuration, what simulation events to track (e.g., ion stopping, vacancy creation), how to bin data (e.g., in cylindrical or Cartesian coordinates), and what physical quantities to record (e.g., ion depth, deposited energy). It will be implemented as a new class hierarchy in C++, inheriting from the existing tally class, and will make use of the ArrayND data structure for multidimensional data storage.

Deliverables include:
a) A customizable tally class with support for user-defined event handling
b)JSON-configurable tally setup (geometry, energy bins, spatial bins, etc.)
c) Sample tally implementations (e.g., ion range profiling)
d) Unit tests, documentation, and tutorials for extending the system

CO...,"The Ziff–Gulari–Barshad (ZGB) model describes how CO and O₂ molecules adsorb and react on a metal surface represented as a square lattice. CO occupies a single site, while O₂ dissociates into two oxygen atoms placed on adjacent sites. When a CO and an O atom meet, they form CO₂, which leaves the surface and frees up space. As the CO partial pressure (yCO) changes, the surface transitions from oxygen-poisoned (no CO₂ production) to reactive (CO₂ formation) and eventually to CO-poisoned. Apothesis is a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator that models these surface reactions with high precision.


Building on the ZGB model and the Apothesis simulator, PyApothesis provides a clean, Python-first workflow for running, analyzing, and sharing Kinetic Monte Carlo experiments. From a single script you can change simulation parameters (temperature, pressure, lattice size, seed), define custom adsorption/reaction/desorption processes, and run reproducible simulations — then immediately visualize results with publication-ready plots. PyApothesis includes time-series coverage plots, stacked-area composition views, process-rate and event-count analyses, spatial coverage maps and profiles, and real-time playback of the lattice (color-coded by species) to inspect microscopic behavior as it unfolds. It automatically produces a comprehensive analysis report (plots, logs, and statistical summaries) so users don’t have to dig through raw files, and it exposes hooks to incorporate lightweight ML models for surrogate predictions, parameter scans, or pattern detection directly from Python. Altogether, PyApothesis turns complex surface-kinetics simulations into an interactive, interpretable, and reproducible toolkit ideal for both researchers and students.",Om Swastik,https://www.notion.so/Google-Summer-of-Code-2025-25b26372a55580a09822c64ff0ed4dfc,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/Hk2P4uiG

Technical Journey & Contributions:
Beginning with learning Julia from scratch and understanding astronomical data formats through NASA HEASARC documentation, I implemented core functionality across multiple areas:

Event Data Processing: Developed comprehensive read events functionality supporting .evt and .fits files from telescopes like NICER, including GTI (Good Time Intervals) handling, energy filtering (filter_energy), and metadata extraction. This enables astronomers to process millions of X-ray events efficiently.

Light Curve Analysis: Built complete lightcurve workflows from raw telescope data to scientific plots, including creation, error handling, rebinning, and intuitive plotting recipes allowing simple plot(lc) commands.

Spectral Analysis: Implemented Power Spectrum and Averaged Power Spectrum analysis for both binned and unbinned data, with multiple normalization options (Leahy, fractional, absolute) and comprehensive visualization capabilities.

Cross-Spectrum Analysis: Tackled the most challenging component - Cross-Spectrum and Averaged Cross-Spectrum implementation for studying phase lags and time delays between different energy bands. This contribution includes advanced plotting for amplitude, coherence, time lag, and phase lag analysis.

The project transformed my understanding from basic stargazing to sophisticated astronomical data analysis, creating tools that real astronomers will use to unlock the mysteries of the universe.",Kashish Shrivastav,https://kashish2210.blogspot.com/2025/08/time-series-analysis-in-stingrayjl.html,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/bDXTorET

This project addressed the problem by implementing a partial download mechanism, where only the required data chunks are downloaded, decompressed, and parsed based on user queries. The parsed results are then cached for reuse.

By integrating OPA's WebAssembly compilation capabilities into Meshery's UI, I aim to enable real-time evaluation of complex Rego policies, providing users with immediate feedback on configuration changes and policy compliance. This enhancement will significantly improve the user experience when designing their designs and will make the policy evaluation distributed hence reducing load on a meshery server Problem Statement Meshery currently doesn't support evaluating policies in real-time on the client side. The existing approach ( relying on the rest api interface exposed by meshery-server) introduce s latency when policy evaluation occurs server-side, limiting the responsiveness of the UI when users make configuration changes. Additionally, as policies become more complex and numerous, the ability to quickly validate configurations against these policies becomes increasingly important for a smooth user experience. Proposed Solution: Use opas capibilty to compile rego policies directly into wasm plans and then integrate the evaluation process in ui using OPA's JavaScript SDK, which provides a simpler way to load and evaluate Rego policies compiled to WebAssembly. This approach is more lightweight and performant . Deliverables : - Real time evaluation of policies in ui - Keeping the support for both targets of evaluation backend or realtime on frontend - Making the evaluation responsive and performant by implementing webworkers , caching",Aabid Ali,https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/15678,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/2aGkn4JN

With the rapid growth of AI applications, WasmEdge plug-ins have become indispensable for tasks such as natural language processing, image synthesis, and speech recognition. However, direct file system access in current implementations exposes critical security risks. To address this, our proposal focuses on designing and implementing a dedicated filesystem sandbox API that restricts file read/write operations to pre-authorized directories. The initial phase will concentrate on the WASI-NN plug-in and other simpler file I/O functions, with potential future enhancements to more complex applications like Stable Diffusion’s image-loading functionality.
Our comprehensive plan includes an in-depth study of the WasmEdge sandbox architecture, API design and integration, modification of internal plugin call patterns, and the development of rigorous test cases to validate sandbox effectiveness. Detailed documentation and developer guidelines will be prepared to facilitate secure plugin development. With a project timeline from June 2 to September 1, this initiative will leverage my background in virtualization, parallel computing and my past contributions to WasmEdge.

Project Goals:
The following are the project goals but not limited to this alone:
- Extend NPF to support IPv6-to-IPv4 translation
- Optimize NAT64 processing within NPF to ensure minimal latency and efficient packet handling, especially in high-traffic environments.
- Passing the information to the kernel, and modifying the kernel packet filter code to process the user/group filtering options and allow/drop packets, in addition to Implementing a robust and efficient NAT64 mechanism within NPF packet filters.

It is written in Haskell and sits between GHC's high-level STG output and low-level native or LLVM code generation.

 Cmm enables multiple backends: a fast native code generator and a more sophisticated LLVM backend. In principle, this design allows users to choose between faster compilation or better runtime performance.

However, like other parts of GHC, the documentation for Cmm is sparse, fragmented, and in many places outdated. For example, references to Static Single Assignment (SSA) form often describe it as ""future work,"" even though there has been a prior attempt at implementing it. There is no cohesive documentation to explain what was done, how the backend currently works, or how one might extend it. This is an obstacle to contributors, researchers, and users alike.

In practice, the LLVM backend suffers from long compile times and a fragile implementation. It depends on a custom LLVM AST that is hard to maintain, and requires users to install a specific, outdated version of LLVM. Meanwhile, the native backend is fast but unable to fully optimize performance-critical code.

This project proposes to address these issues in stages:
1. Document the Cmm pipeline, the backend interfaces, and existing SSA infrastructure.
2. Then, depending on the mentor's and community's feedback, pursue one of two improvement paths:",Diego Antonio Rosario Palomino,https://github.com/GunpowderGuy/cmm-documentation,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/BvobfRuf

This will improve the effectiveness of the cBioPortal database by prioritizing the display of relevant genes to each disease subtype. To achieve this goal, a Large Language Model (LLM) such as GPT-4o, will be fine-tuned with prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide domain-specific knowledge and context. The goal is to train the LLM to connect relevant genes to each OncoTree code. 
Approach:
LLM Selection: GPT-4o is a strong candidate due to its versatility and performance in various NLP tasks.
Prompt Engineering: Develop efficient prompts for the selected LLM to generate gene lists.
RAG Component: Implement a RAG component to provide context to the LLM and enhance accuracy using e-utilities to retrieve curated literature from NCBI GeneReviews and ClinVar.
Validation: Cross-reference the generated gene lists with expert-curated resources like ClinGen and variant frequencies in cBioPortal, and COSMIC.
Evaluation: Continuously monitor the model's performance using validation sets and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
Deployment: Integrate the solution into the cBioPortal platform such as sorting variants on patient view pages by relevant genes first.

The project will allow users to define floorplans using arbitrary rectilinear shapes made of 90° corners. It involves three main components: accepting polygonal input during floorplan setup, generating standard cell rows and routing tracks that follow the shape boundaries, and updating the pin placement logic to work with irregular outlines.

By enabling these capabilities, OpenROAD will become more flexible and suitable for real-world designs where blocks may need to fit together like puzzle pieces.

As such, recommendation systems are vital to systems today and is a important field of research.

Despite widespread use, traditional sequential recommendation systems face limitations. They primarily on historical user interactions to predict future preferences however struggle to capture contextual dependencies and adapting to dynamic user behaviors. Similarly, existing models predefined embeddings which restrict the ability to adapt and generalize. As such these problems lead to reduced recommendation accuracy, typically for example in cold-start users.

However, its current implementation supports only basic evaluations for tabular data and lacks both privacy-aware assessments and the ability to handle unstructured data formats like images.

This project proposes to address these limitations in two structured phases. In Phase 1, I will enhance AIDRIN’s capabilities for tabular datasets by implementing essential privacy-preserving metrics—such as k-Anonymity, l-Diversity, t-Closeness, MM Risk Score, and Entropy-Based Disclosure Risk—alongside other key checks for class imbalance, feature correlation, and model evaluation. These assessments will be supported by intuitive visualizations to help users make informed decisions about data quality and compliance.

In Phase 2, I will extend AIDRIN to support image datasets by integrating pretrained vision models to generate semantic embeddings. These embeddings will enable readiness evaluations such as duplicate and outlier detection, class imbalance analysis, completeness checks, and fairness diagnostics (when label or attribute metadata is available). The goal is to replicate AIDRIN’s structured readiness evaluation pipeline for visual data in a modular and reusable manner.

Deliverables include:

Privacy and imbalance metric suite for tabular data with visual summaries
Embedding-based readiness evaluation pipeline for image datasets
Integration with pretrained vision models (ViT, CLIP, DINOv2)
CLI tool for executing and exporting assessment results
Documentation, testing, and demonstration notebooks

This approach aimed to give the Seam/NRP community an intelligent tool for faster troubleshooting and more resilient operations.

As the work progressed, and with the rapid growth of agentic AI approaches, the project shifted toward building an Intelligent Kubernetes Management and Observability System, inspired by the INFOGENT design. Rather than focusing solely on anomaly detection, the system was developed as a modular Python framework that integrates Kubernetes operations with large language model–driven explanations. It classifies user input as either an operational command or a documentation query, executes the corresponding action, and returns either the system output or a clear explanation drawn from NRP knowledge.

The outcome is a practical, open-source framework that provides both command execution and AI-assisted guidance. It lowers the barrier for researchers working with Kubernetes, helps them understand and troubleshoot workloads more easily, and extends the Seam initiative by showing how agentic AI systems can enhance usability in high-performance computing environments.",Manish Kamalakar Reddy,https://mreddy10.pages.nrp-nautilus.io/gsocnrp/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/fPp1JXbl

At its core lies a dynamic side panel that fundamentally reimagines how users inspect Apache Beam pipelines - consolidating previously scattered visualizations while preserving the documented backward compatibility requirements. This architectural shift directly addresses the project's stated pain points of vertical space consumption and redundant JavaScript code by implementing the described collapsible interface and centralized rendering system. The solution carefully balances innovation with technical constraints through a hybrid approach combining kernel-side HTML generation for reliability with frontend D3.js rendering for interactivity, both explicitly prioritized in the project's technical specifications. Beyond basic visualization, the implementation delivers on the documented cluster management capabilities, providing seamless Flink/Dataproc integration exactly as outlined in the side panel use cases. Every component maintains strict adherence to the original vision - from the multi-tab comparison interface described in the design workflow to the incremental data loading strategy for large datasets. By systematically executing the documented requirements without introducing unsupported features, BeamVision transforms the proposal's vision of ""better UX when exploring pipeline states"" into a production-ready reality while laying foundations for future extensibility through the approved plugin architecture.

In Apache RocketMQ 5.x POP orderly consumption, when a PushConsumer's ReceiveMessage response is lost due to network issues, the client generates a new attemptId for the next pull. However, the Broker blocks this new request because it still holds the original attemptId as active until its invisibleTime expires, causing consumption stalling.

Solution:
1. Enhance client-side logic (ProcessQueueImpl) to add an application-level timer for each ReceiveMessage request
2. If timer expires without receiving response or definitive gRPC error:
   • Client assumes response was lost
   • Reuses original attemptId (instead of generating new one) for retry
3. Leverages Broker's existing capability to handle reentrant requests with same attemptId

Deliverables:
• Modified Java client code (rocketmq-clients-java)

• Updated documentation if needed
• Pull Requests to relevant RocketMQ repos

Despite Pharo’s strengths as a live programming platform, it currently lacks a native and user-friendly interface for interacting with LLMs to assist with code explanation, generation, documentation, and debugging.

To address this, the project proposes a seamless, modular, and extensible system that connects Pharo with both online (OpenAI, DeepSeek) and offline (TinyLLaMA, Mistral-7B via Ollama) models. A multi-tab chat interface will allow users to manage multiple contextual conversations, while intelligent AI commands (e.g., /explain, /generate tests, /refactor) will directly support day-to-day coding workflows. Memory optimization techniques—including smart caching, chat pruning, and lazy model loading—will ensure smooth performance even in long sessions.

A key innovation includes experimenting with pseudo-parallelism in Pharo’s single-threaded architecture by spawning secondary images to offload heavy LLM processing. This enables parallel task handling without compromising the responsiveness of the main Pharo image.

By midterm, users will have access to a working chat UI, multi-LLM switching, and foundational coding actions. By the final evaluation, ChatPharo will evolve into a context-aware assistant capable of inline suggestions, AI-driven debugging, and scalable architecture for future extensions.

At the same time, there is an effort to bring more programmability and portability when writing code for the GPU. One of such efforts is the implementation of the libc and libc++ in LLVM project for execution on the accelerator itself. This allows standard host applications to run on the GPU automatically, without modification to the user code. One consideration of such an approach is that some functions are not natively supported on the GPU and rely on RPC calls to the host. This poses a limitation on the bandwidth of data transfer.
Thus, this project aims to improve current file operations triggered by GPU, leveraging the new Linux io_uring interface. io_uring allows the program to register a queue to asynchronously request file operations and pool the completion by interacting with such a queue. Apart from registering the queue, requesting and polling operations do not require a syscall, making it faster and more flexible than regular POSIX operations or Linux AIO calls. We will map and register/pin a memory region on the GPU side and use that region for io_uring interaction, driven by the GPU. 
We expect such a process to deliver more performance than current RPC round-trips to complete I/O transfers, which require a CPU polling thread for each request and do not come close to the theoretical bandwidth of PCIe interfaces.",Rodrigo Ceccato,https://gist.github.com/rodrigo-ceccato/6475e8a3aaa669661386203be38b9093,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/oRouV5VX

The approach involves writing unit proofs for critical functions in Rust vmm and verifying them using Kani, a Rust-based bounded model checker. These proofs, which will be integrated into continuous integration (CI), will not only check correctness for all executions within a bound but also verify memory safety, especially in areas mixing safe and unsafe Rust.

Community Benefits:

1. Increased trust in Rust vmm’s conformance to the VirtIO spec, benefiting all dependent projects.
2. Maintainable proofs using the Code-As-Spec paradigm, making them accessible to Rust vmm developers.
3. Demonstrates the practical value of formal verification for ensuring correctness in critical open source infrastructure.",Siddharth Priya,https://gist.github.com/priyasiddharth/baf36c176faf77144770ef36ee121022,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/jBUdLT2D

If the user wishes to store vector embeddings for a document, they have to use a separate solution and then manually insert them into the database. This is inefficient and complicates related pipelines.

The goal of this project is twofold:
1. Create a function plugin that implements a function to query OpenAI’s API to generate vector embeddings for a given input.
2. Implement a concept of “expensive” functions in the MariaDB server. When expensive functions are used in stored generated columns, they should not be recomputed whenever possible (for example during ALTER TABLE commands). Instead, the old values should be copied to the new table, just like with regular columns

For this project to be successfully completed, the goal would be to create a PR to MariaDB’s server repository that:
1. Implements a function plugin for generating vector embeddings via API calls to OpenAI
2. Introduces and implements the concept of “expensive” functions, to avoid recomputing them whenever possible

One method filters data on the primary node by not writing unwanted events to the binary log, However, this approach risks losing important data and can cause issues with point-in-time recovery. 
The alternative is to send all data from the primary node to the replicas and let them filter out what they don't need although this method not only increases network traffic and resource usage but also creates a risk of inconsistent data if replicas are misconfigured.

This proposal suggests adding a filter on the primary node that checks which data should be sent to the replicas, while still logging all events in the binary log. The filter will help control what gets replicated without affecting the ability to recover data. 

This would lead to less network bandwidth being used, less work needed on the replicas, and more consistent replicas by applying the same filtering rules in one place (primary filter instead of replica filter).",Mohanad Khaled,https://github.com/MohanadKh03/mariadb-gsoc25,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/uzgYlzc5

IP cameras are frequent targets for cyberattacks due to their widespread use and often weak security. Current honeypots like SweetCam lack comprehensive protocol support and realistic emulation, limiting their effectiveness in detecting and analyzing threats.  
Solution:
This project aims to transform SweetCam into a versatile, multi-protocol honeypot by:  
1. Expanding protocol support for RTSP and ONVIF, enabling deeper interaction with attackers.  
2. Introducing template-based device emulation using YAML to simulate real-world cameras (e.g., Dahua, Hikvision).  
3. Improving usability with Docker enhancements, automated configuration, and a realistic HTTP interface featuring error simulation and multi-language support.  
Deliverables:  
1. A production-ready SweetCam with RTSP/ONVIF support and 5+ device templates.  
2. Optimized Docker deployment (multi-stage builds, Compose profiles).  
3. Enhanced HTTP interface (login flows, error simulation, i18n).  
4. Comprehensive documentation, including setup guides and protocol specifications.  
Impact:
This upgrade will equip researchers and defenders with a powerful tool to study attacker behavior, improve IoT security, and contribute to the broader honeypot ecosystem.",c1nk,https://github.com/cinkpts3/GSoC-2025-SweetCam,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/Z0fvicFa

""Given around 12000 probes worldwide and the system collects traceroute data from these probes every 15 mins. The measurement has been running for 2+ years. The maximum hops a probe made in this measurement was 32.""

RIPE Atlas provides a REST API to fetch the measurement result. However, the measurement result object can be a large json response. It increases the memory usage on the server while creating a huge response. If the server succeeds in creating a huge response, the client device may not afford to render an SVG graph given the large traceroute data.

- Narrowing down the search according to the inputs (probe ids to include, time frame) provided by the user
- Paginate the measurement result API call by probe ids, start time and stop time

Experiment rendering the network graph using more efficient graph libraries and test. If by testing, the results are improved then replace the current implementation of v-network-graph.

While minor adjustments are required for the ticketing components, the primary focus lies on modernising the talk and video modules, which currently rely heavily on VueJS 2, as well as on updating project-specific plugins. The objective is to replace all existing VueJS 2 code with VueJS 3 across the entire platform while preserving existing functionality and API compatibility.
As the Eventyay platform is being consolidated into a single repository, the project also includes implementing additional API features where necessary to support the unified infrastructure. The upgrade improves the maintainability and performance of the platform, aligns it with current best practices, and ensures long-term sustainability of the frontend codebase. 
Throughout the project, Vue dependencies are upgraded, and components are systematically refactored to address breaking changes introduced in Vue 3. Extensive compatibility testing is carried out to ensure stability across all migrated features. Updated components are made fully functional under Vue 3, with a gradual transition from the Options API to the Composition API where appropriate, leveraging the benefits of improved structure, reusability, and maintainability. In parallel, the continuous integration pipeline is refined to support automated testing and deployment, including the seamless rollout of updated documentation that reflects the evolving architecture and feature set of the unified platform.",Saksham Sirohi,https://gist.github.com/Saksham-Sirohi/39628b2c39922a6c4082cc9f8061bf60,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/ejC7rj48

The goal of this project is to take Badge Magic to the next level by adding more creative and interactive features for users. Right now, the app supports basic text rendering, but there’s a lot of potential to make it more fun, flexible, and powerful.

The plan is to introduce multi-font and multi-colour text support, allow users to create and store custom animations, and even play simple games like Snake and Pong directly on their LED badges. Along with that, I’ll work on improving how the app adapts to different badge sizes, add more control through advanced badge settings, and automate the deployment process across all platforms supported by Flutter.

What I’ll deliver:

Support for different fonts, colours, gradients, and per-character styling,
Storage slots for saving and editing custom animations,
Interactive mini-games are playable on the badge,
Advanced configuration options (e.g., Bluetooth toggle, brightness),
Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS, Web) with an improved UI,
Proper testing and documentation to ensure everything works smoothly.

By the end of the project, Badge Magic will be more customizable, more interactive, and ready to support a wider range of devices and users.",Samruddhi Rahegaonkar,https://gist.github.com/samruddhi-Rahegaonkar/e63e01635346a1dd67fcf567bd152414,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/EAWwj9Nd

For all of these computations, a large number of complex integrals must be evaluated. Gbasis can compute various one- and two-electron integrals, but as the system size increases, these integrations become increasingly time- and memory-intensive.

Screening is common in computational chemistry, and most codes use it to skip unnecessary integral evaluations. Currently, Gbasis applies screening only to overlap integrals.

2. Break down complex commands into steps and execute them safely.
3. Prevent harmful actions with built-in safety checks.
4. Let admins manage and review all workflows.

Deliverables:
1. A app that understands natural language commands.

Currently, omegaUp's public courses are managed manually, which can be time-consuming and lacks community involvement. By using GitHub, contributors can submit pull requests (PRs) to update course content, which will be automatically validated and deployed using GitHub Actions and omegaUp's API.

Key components of the project include:
1. Course Migration: All public courses will be uploaded to a GitHub repository, structured by course and content type (lectures, problems, etc.).
2. CI/CD Workflow: A GitHub Actions pipeline will validate and deploy updates when a PR is merged. This pipeline will automatically check for any changes in problems and deploy only the modified content.
3. API Integration: The system will use omegaUp’s API to upload content after successful review and approval of changes.
4. Community Collaboration: Contributors can suggest improvements via PRs, with a review process ensuring quality control before deployment.
5. Automated Testing: The CI/CD pipeline will run validation scripts to check metadata, problem structure, and other course details before deployment.
6. Security: A review and approval mechanism will prevent unauthorized or malicious content from being deployed.

The project aims to enhance omegaUp’s educational content by leveraging GitHub’s collaboration model, ensuring faster updates, better quality control, and reduced manual workload for omegaUp staff.

While most of the Fortran interfaces can be generated automatically from the C-API, functions with ""complex"" arguments such as procedure pointers, pointers to arrays, and strings require the manual creation of interface code on both the C and the Fortran side. Moreover, due to the discrepancy of features between C and Fortran, a one-to-one translation of APIs leads to Fortran interfaces that don't leverage the capabilities of modern Fortran. Examples include overloaded functions for different types in Fortran, for which a C-API requires VOID and an explicit type argument and arrays, for which the length is part of the type definition in Fortran but requires a second argument in the C-API.

To ensure code quality, Uyuni employs two types of tests:

1. Continuous Integration Tests: These tests are run periodically on the master branch to catch breakages that have slipped through earlier testing. When these tests fail, developers must revisit older tasks, leading to frequent context switching and reduced productivity.

2. Pull Request Acceptance Tests: These tests are run on new pull requests to prevent breakages from reaching the master branch. They provide fast feedback to developers, helping them fix issues while they are still focused on their tasks.

Currently, Pull Request Acceptance Tests execute most of the test suite, with an average runtime of one hour. This delays feedback for developers and increases infrastructure costs.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that, using past pull requests, test results, code coverage data, and other relevant information, predicts which small subset of tests is most likely to fail for a new pull request.

This project proposes adding native Snap support to Uyuni, including install, update, remove, and channel management. By extending Uyuni’s capabilities to cover Snap, this work fills a key gap and ensures continued relevance for Ubuntu system management.

I explored how Uyuni manages CVE audits and package upgrades for Ubuntu systems. Initially, Uyuni connects to client machines via SSH to install and register the Salt Minion. Once set up, all communication occurs through Salt’s remote execution system, eliminating the need for SSH. Salt gathers package data using grains, pillars, and custom modules, which Uyuni then compares to its centralized SUSE Manager database.

For CVE auditing, Uyuni fetches security metadata (e.g., CVEs, OVAL data) from upstream sources like Ubuntu Security Notices and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. When Salt reports installed packages, Uyuni analyzes the data and generates patch or upgrade recommendations. APT repositories are mirrored into structured software channels, allowing clients to receive updates without direct internet access.

Building on this workflow, I propose extending Uyuni to support Snap packages. While Snap lacks structured CVE metadata, we can implement a version-based upgrade system: Uyuni retrieves the latest Snap versions from the Snap Store and compares them to client versions reported via Salt, suggesting upgrades when newer versions exist.

To support airgapped environments, we can pre-download .snap and .assert files on a connected system and distribute them through Uyuni’s software channels. Additionally, to manage storage and stability, Uyuni admins can choose which Snap channels (stable, beta, etc.) to mirror—defaulting to stable.

We seek to bridge that gap by developing a system that supports LNS arithmetic while maintaining compatibility with PyTorch. By creating custom layers, optimizers, and benchmarking tools, the project will enable the simulation of LNS arithmetic in FP hardware for neural network training and inference.

My goal is to develop a distributed algorithm for error correction and assembly, making it easier to process large and complex metagenomic datasets efficiently.

To achieve this, I plan to use distributed computing frameworks like Dask to improve scalability, ensuring that even terabyte-scale datasets can be handled smoothly. I also aim to design better error correction techniques to preserve low-abundance species and improve assembly accuracy. Additionally, I want to explore GPU acceleration and machine learning to refine error detection and optimize processing times.

At the core of my approach is a distributed de Bruijn graph assembly algorithm that constructs graphs from k-mers while clustering and annotating nodes based on coverage, GC content, and paired-end data. Unlike existing tools like Velvet (designed for single-genome assembly) and MetaVelvet (for metagenomic assembly), my method will efficiently break down graphs into species-specific subgraphs, reducing errors and improving the quality of the final assemblies. This will lead to better contig generation, taxonomic classification, and error correction, while also ensuring the method scales well for large datasets.

Deliverables:
1. A distributed error correction module that improves accuracy while retaining biologically important data.
2. An optimized assembly pipeline to generate high-quality contigs and scaffolds for taxonomic and functional analysis.
3. A novel species-aware de Bruijn graph decomposition to improve metagenomic assembly and reduce errors.
4. Scalability improvements to ensure smooth performance across HPC clusters and cloud platforms.
5. AI/ML enhancements to improve error correction and sequencing accuracy.

Rising sea levels, melting sea ice, and shifting environmental conditions make accurate modeling of coastal changes a pressing need. Current approaches often miss key environmental variables like tidal shifts, temperature variation, and wave energy. Moreover, manual coastline digitization remains time-consuming and inefficient, limiting scalability.
The aim of the project is to develop and deliver a highly accurate, automated model that can extract vectorized coastlines directly from PlanetLabs satellite imagery. This will build upon the existing pipeline and model by re-training the water detection (NDWI-based) and segmentation methods to perform well on PlanetLabs’ imagery.
Further aims include:
Ensuring the extraction is robust in challenging conditions such as water shadows, buildings, artifacts, and especially steep, cliff-like coastal areas.
Integrating additional data sources if needed, such as SWIR data   
the project will also explore the use of auxiliary data sources (Landsat & sentinel) and  elevation data for addition of topographic information, to improve accuracy.

Inkscape currently lacks an easy and intuitive way to modify colors within a selected artwork. This project aims to introduce a ""Recolor Artwork"" tool that allows users to quickly adjust colors in their selection, making color experimentation and fine-tuning more efficient.
The feature will extract all colors (fills, strokes, and gradient stops) from the selected objects and present them in a list. Users will be able to edit colors by either clicking on a color in the list or using a color wheel, which will help visualize relationships between colors. The tool will feature live preview, allowing real-time updates on the canvas, and upon deselection, the new colors will be applied permanently. If performance concerns arise, an apply/load button or a pop-up dialog similar to the LPE editor will be considered.
Deliverables:
A dialog or pop-up UI that lists all colors from the selection.
Color editing options, including direct tweaking and a color wheel.
Live preview of color changes on the canvas.
Performance optimizations, including a possible load/apply mechanism if needed.

Lenny is an open-source, self-hosted lending system inspired by the Internet Archive and Koha. Its mission is to give libraries ownership of their digital collections while offering a flexible and cost-effective alternative to proprietary platforms.

At its core, Lenny based on python features a FastAPI backend that handles borrowing, returning, and waitlists, with support for Readable, Borrowable, and Print-Disabled books. Security and compliance are provided through LCP DRM and Geo-IP restrictions, while PostgreSQL triggers automate loan expirations. An OPDS feed enables integration with Open Library, Thorium, and other reading systems.

Deployment is simple with Docker (Alpine + Nginx), and a React dashboard allows librarians to set lending rules like loan durations and waitlists.

To improve accessibility, the companion Lenny-app (TurboRepo monorepo) includes:
	1.	A sandbox demo preloaded with 500+ e-books to showcase the system in action powered by Lenny.
	2.	A documentation site that supports integration, open-source contributions, and extensions.

Built with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Express.js, Lenny-app is production-ready yet flexible for experimentation. Together, Lenny + Lenny-app deliver both the backend infrastructure and the user interface needed to power community-driven digital lending.

By combining secure architecture, a ready-to-use demo, and developer-focused documentation, Lenny provides libraries with a scalable and future-proof solution to manage digital lending independently and expand access for their patrons.",Roni Bhakta,https://blog.openlibrary.org/2025/08/29/bringing-sidewalk-libraries-online/,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/WcVnJVdw

The goal is to bring Pwndbg enhancements to the WinDbg console — providing a similar experience to using it with GDB or LLDB. End users should be able to access all native WinDbg features while also using Pwndbg commands and context windows.

The project leverages WinDbg’s `wdbgexts` or `DbgEng` to interface with Pwndbg. This requires either an RPC client-server protocol or native integration of Pwndbg on Windows.

Pixel size is a metadata item enabling conversion of image pixels into real-world measurements. 
Whilst pixel size is not currently processed in ilastik image sets, the program is used extensively in scientific applications, and introducing real-world measurements would enable development of several key features that would allow more in-depth quantitative analysis of image data, such as object displacement and velocity in video tracking, and real-world area calculation of segmentations/ volume calculation of carvings.

Once the metadata is extracted at the image input end, it is possible to feed it directly into the data pipeline, so it can be picked back up within any relevant workflow. This facilitates feature development, as it then becomes possible to work directly with the metadata values within the workflow. Once the backends of these features have been developed, they will be implemented on the front-end via Qt.

The key deliverables of this project are:
 Implement pixel size metadata into workflows, such that the metadata remains present in project files, output images, and exported datasets; 
Enable calculating areas of image segmentations; 
Enable calculating volumes of image carvings; 
Enable recording of object displacement in video tracking; 
Enable measurement of object velocity in video tracking; 
Produce detailed and well-written documentation, and ensure  relevant test scripts for each feature are made available.

Vorta provides a user-friendly desktop GUI for Borg, while Borgmatic serves as a command-line interface for managing backups. This proposal outlines four projects designed to improve the functionality, security, and usability of both Vorta and Borgmatic. 

For the first project aims to add a new feature to the Vorta GUI that lets users change their repository passphrase. Changing a Borg repository passphrase is a feature that’s often requested but hasn’t been fully implemented yet within Vorta.  This would make security management more accessible and eliminate the need for users to use Borg directly for such tasks. 

The second project aims to develop a custom file selector with PyQt6 FileDialog, which will handle multiple file and directory selections in one window. At the moment, Vorta has separate dialogs for selecting files and directories. This allows users to select both files and directories in a single window.

The third project aims to introduce a much-needed improvement by adding a file selector dialog that allows users to pick files and directories to exclude directly through the UI. Right now, users who want to exclude certain files or directories from their backup have to manually type in paths or use patterns. This will allow users to eliminate the need for manual match expressions and reducing errors.

Chebfun is a numerical computation package for MATLAB that provides a framework for representing functions in a symbolic manner using ”Chebyshev technology”, a term coined by the package authors to describe the use of Chebyshev polynomials to represent functions up to machine precision. GNU Octave is supposed to be mostly compatible with MATLAB, so Chebfun should ideally work without change on the former, but there are some slight differences and unimplemented features in Octave that make this difficult. Primarily, the main issue is that Octave’s support for object-oriented programming (classdef) is not as feature complete and as stable as MATLAB’s, which is a major problem since Chebfun is written in classdef.

 The goal of this project is to port Chebfun to GNU Octave, and to make it work as a dropin replacement for the MATLAB version. Since fixing classdef is not a feasible/recommended goal for a GSoC project, I will instead focus primarily on making the necessary changes to the Chebfun codebase to make it work in Octave.

VLC’s macOS interface has fallen behind modern design standards, creating a disjointed experience compared to its intuitive iOS/tvOS counterparts. The current AppKit-based UI lacks macOS Sequoia's visual polish, struggles with libvlc’s newer playback features (e.g., frame-accurate seeking), and suffers from inefficient media library management. This outdated design hinders usability and fails to make use of macOS’s native capabilities.

Solution:
Redesign VLC’s macOS interface using AppKit to implement a pre-approved, user-tested design that integrates into macOS visual aesthetics and libvlc’s advanced APIs. The overhaul will:
1. Replace legacy Carbon-era UI components with modern NSCollectionView and NSSplitViewController layouts.
2. Integrate libvlc’s latest playback controls (frame stepping, HDR metadata) into native transport UIs.
3. Rebuild the media library using Core Data for performance and NSDiffableDataSource for real-time updates.
4. Prioritize system consistency with SF Symbols, vibrant materials, and macOS accessibility standards.

Deliverables:
1. Modern UI Components:
- Unified toolbar with adaptive controls (NSToolbarItemGroup)
- Redesigned media library with thumbnail grid (NSCollectionView) and smart filters (NSPredicateEditor)
2. Enhanced Playback:
- Frame-accurate seekbar with NSSlider tick marks synced to libvlc’s next_frame() API
- HDR tone mapping toggle using CAMetalLayer integration
3. Optimized Media Management:
- Rules-based playlists backed by Core Data
- Spotlight-like search using NSFetchRequest
4. Developer Documentation:
- Migration guide for plugin developers
- NSAccessibility implementation notes

The implementation involves translating CUDA/OpenCL FDTD kernels to Metal Shading Language (MSL), creating Python bindings to manage Metal devices and memory, and integrating Metal as a first-class backend option alongside CPU and CUDA/OpenCL.
Key components include:
Finalizing Metal device detection and selection
Completing MSL kernels for field updates, PML boundaries, sources, and outputs
Implementing Python interfaces for Metal device management and memory operations
Integrating Metal execution into the main solver loop
Creating a comprehensive testing framework to validate numerical accuracy
Optimizing performance through profiling and tuning
Documenting the Metal backend for users and developers
The project will follow a structured development approach, starting with reviewing existing code in PR #457, implementing remaining kernels, building integration tests, and finally optimizing performance. This systematic progression ensures a stable, validated, and efficient Metal implementation.
The primary challenge lies in achieving competitive performance compared to existing implementations, requiring a deep understanding of Apple's GPU architecture and careful optimization.
Upon completion, the Metal port will enhance gprMax's capabilities on Apple hardware, potentially offering superior performance to CPU implementations. This will benefit researchers, students, and professionals in electromagnetics, particularly those using Apple devices, and demonstrate Metal's viability for scientific computing applications.",Manobhav Sachan,https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax/pull/504,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/lKjuDV7t

    Expected outcome: A ROS 2 command line interface ros2cli with doctor sub-command and ros2_documentation.
    Detailed description: Currently, the ROS 2 doctor subcommand, ros2 doctor, is lacking a lot of useful information, such as ROS environment variables, RMW-specific environment variables, and configuration and service information (number of endpoints, QoS compatibility status, etc). This information is really important and useful for debugging issues with ROS 2, and would greatly improve our ability to support issues reported by our user community. In other words, adding this new information to our existing ROS 2 Doctor command would accelerate community communication and make bug reports much more precise! Aligned with ros2cli development, this project also targets the implementation of improved documentation on how to create an issue report with a new issue template.

My contribution to the multi-agent traffic...","I am Ryan, a college student finishing their last semester for a bachelors in computer science.

My contribution to the multi-agent traffic optimization project would be to take the lessons I’ve learned from my previous bevy projects, and use them to update and improve rmf_site’s infrastructure over the course of several stages, and to use those improvements to add procedural generation for the tests sites that will then be used for multi-agent optimization testing.

The stages for this would be as follows:

1. bevy 0.12 -> latest version of bevy + library updates.. 
2. Compile time improvements
3. Debug tool improvements 
4. test scenario automation through procedural generation.

Update everything:

The first thing to do would be to update rmf_site bevy and all other dependencies to their latest versions. I’ve done this for all my projects since bevy 0.11, and I can do it for rmf_site too.

Improve Compile TImes:

The next step would be improving compile times. When I tested this project on my local machine. Iterative compile times took around 50 seconds.

With the appropriate restructuring of crates, slimmer crate imports, more granular feature flags, and the introduction of the mold linker, these recompile times could be cut down to around 2-7 seconds.

Improve debug tools:

After that, then comes adding more debug tools. We can add bevy_inspector_egui for bevy entity/component inspection, bevy_tracing for performance optimization via Tracy.

Automate test scenarios: 

Lastly, would be adding procedural generation for test sites.

First, would be adding initial tests with randomized prefab placement, then moving to procedural room layouts from tiles, then assigning different layout kinds to each of these, (storage room, office room, etc..), and then finally connecting these different layouts together into a single site.",rydb,https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WDaapN4P9tmfhY0Jw-i8qINtxgLVzGwPFq1EbjpzeE/edit?usp=sharing,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/2L1pxAFK

It takes care of resource constraints between different controllers and hardware components, asynchronous operation of controllers, etc. As of now, controller_manager publishes the diagnostics of itself, and for controllers and hardware components about their lifecycle state and operational statistics such as their periodicity and their execution time. However, A current limitation of the framework is that hardware components, e.g. the ros2_control hardware driver plugin for a given robot, doesn't have a good API for reporting the diagnostics of its own hardware, for instance, the state of the CAN Bus, some internal motor control board stats like temperature, error codes etc. This integration would make the ros2_control, provide complete diagnostics within its ecosystem. This project focuses on setting up an API that hardware manufacturers & driver maintainers can use to report things with minimal code changes to their existing setups.

This project thus aims to add reporting capabilities to the hardware components with minimal changes. It will also aim to unify the three existing hardware interfaces into one as they currently contain a lot of similar code.

number of projects and discussions happening across its platforms. Newcomers, as well 
as contributors unfamiliar with specific parts of the ecosystem, often struggle to 
navigate and understand the breadth of information shared. While the general Slack 
channels host a wealth of discussions, support is inconsistent and depends on the 
availability and responsiveness of community members. Similarly, valuable insights are 
often scattered across community blogs, mailing lists, and Jira tickets, making it 
challenging to locate relevant information quickly.

chatbot that leverages messages from Slack channels, posts from community blogs, 
updates from Jira, and other conversational and announcement platforms used by the

updates, community decisions, usage guidance, and more—based on real-time 
information and past conversations. The core system will utilize a Retrieval-Augmented

serve accurate responses to user questions. The system will also evaluate different vector 
stores and embedding strategies to optimize retrieval from unstructured conversational

Past projects for Rust in FreeBSD started with Johannes Lundberg's Master's Thesis, where he created a RustKPI, e1000 Rust Network Driver, and a Rust kmod Hello World Example. From this, we saw Anatol Ulrich create a Hello World kernel module and a research article about writing FreeBSD kernel modules in Rust by David Young. Outside these contributions, Rust's current progress in FreeBSD is very shallow. This lack of depth makes it difficult for others to learn and build upon. I propose to analyze and extend the past work of others to assist anyone wanting to further the development of Rust in the FreeBSD kernel.

My project will focus on these primary goals:

1. Creating tests in /usr/tests tree using ATF & Kyua for an existing Rust Driver

2. Use these tests to find errors in the driver logic, repairing them when needed.

3. Create a updated environment where developers can easily code and compile Rust FreeBSD device drivers.

4. Create both a Hello World driver and an Echo character driver with this environment.

6. Publishing clean and effective Rust device driver documentation for future developers to expand and work with the environment.",Acesp25,https://gist.github.com/Acesp25/8928e35e710fdce1896b5448fc6327df,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/FnDSAZEj

Sockstat is a useful FreeBSD utility for displaying active sockets, but its current output format is rigid and lacks flexibility. The -w option is a workaround to accommodate wide output, and the tool does not support structured data formats.

Proposed Solution:
This project aims to improve sockstat by integrating libxo, which will allow structured output in multiple formats (JSON, XML, etc.). Additionally, the column sizes will be dynamically adjusted to enhance readability, eliminating the need for the -w option.

Deliverables:

-> Rewrite sockstat output using libxo for JSON, XML, and other formats.
-> Implement automatic column sizing for better readability.
-> Remove the -w option and replace it with a more intelligent formatting approach.
-> Ensure backward compatibility and proper testing.

As it currently stands, it is widely available across 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, with specially tailored manuals towards Windows™ and UNIX. 

FreeBSD has implemented ACPI, utilizing Intel™’s ACPI Computer Architecture (ACPICA). The major contention point is that it is outside the loader. In this state, it is inefficient; information that’s only available to ACPI, is therefore unavailable to the boot loader. As such, the boot loader essentially has to guess what that information is, and is often wrong.

detect, visualize, and understand network partitions. The focus will be on implementing
efficient graph algorithms to identify disconnected components and communities within
the Tor network. By utilizing Neo4j's Graph Data Science (GDS) library, we can apply
community detection and clustering algorithms to find potential partitions in the directed
graph that represents the Tor network.

However, its runtime metadata file, drivedb.h, suffers from inconsistent labeling of attributes such as SSD wear, endurance, and temperature, which hinders meaningful monitoring and integration with observability tools like Prometheus/Grafana in environments such as Ceph clusters.

This project proposed a two-part solution. First, I added interpretation logic in the smartmontools C++ codebase to normalize metrics (e.g., converting wear remaining to wear used as 100 - value) and expose them under a consistent JSON key. Second, I developed regex-based classification and drafted a standard spec to map freeform SMART attribute labels in drivedb.h to a consistent set. Together, these changes improve data reliability and facilitate integration with monitoring dashboards.

Deliverables include:

Interpretation logic enhancement in the smartmontools C++ source

Problem Being Solved
Code reviews are often time-consuming and inconsistent, especially when identifying complex issues such as security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and maintainability concerns. This project addresses these challenges by automating the review process while providing actionable, contextual feedback.

Proposed Solution
The solution employs a modular webhook-based architecture with the following components:
1. A webhook receiver to capture GitHub events (e.g., pull request creations/updates).
2. A code fetcher to retrieve and parse changed files.
3. An orchestrator to coordinate multiple analysis tools.
4. A result aggregator to combine findings and remove duplicates.
5. A response handler to post intelligent comments directly on pull requests.

Key Deliverables
1. A system that provides actionable, contextual feedback rather than merely flagging issues.
2. Support for multiple programming languages (initially Go, JavaScript, and Python).
3. Implementation of dependency vulnerability detection.
4. An AI-powered layer to enhance basic linter outputs.

Problem solved - Current AI models struggle to generate high-quality Unit Tests for large codebases without a deep, structured understanding of the source code.

Solution Plan- 
1. I implemented code parsing using tree-sitter to create semantic chunks, preserving essential context.
2. Then generating embeddings for these chunks with Gemini, openAI, huggigface and store them in a Milvus vector database.
3. I'm utilizing HNSW indexing within Milvus for efficient semantic similarity search.
4. Then I have extracted code relationships (function calls, class inheritance etc.) and store them as a knowledge graph in Neo4j.
5. Embeddings are generated with Gemini :- https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard
6. I have developed a dynamic indexing mechanism (using file watching/Git hooks, potentially enhanced by Difftastic) to keep both Milvus and Neo4j synchronized with code changes.
7. Then I build a hybrid retrieval system querying both Milvus (for semantic relevance) and Neo4j (for structural context).
8. Then I integrated this combined context into Keploy's existing Unit Test Generation (UTG) workflow, feeding it to the Gemini API for test creation.
9.  Then I need further suggestion to implement an LLM-as-a-judge component to evaluate the generated tests.

Deliverables:- A robust GraphRAG system integrated into Keploy. This includes codebase indexing (vector embeddings in Milvus, structural graph in Neo4j), dynamic index updates, hybrid context retrieval, and integration with the Gemini, leading to substantially improved Unit Test Generation quality and relevance for users with large or complex codebases.

Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) provide a mathematical framework to describe such complex stochastic behaviour. Understanding the hidden physics within these systems is pretty much essential for analyzing their stochastic and nonlinear dynamics.

The NeuralPDE package in the SciML ecosystem currently lacks documentation for its existing SDE Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) solver and does not yet support multidimensional SDEs and SPDEs. This project aims to document the existing solver while also extending it to include PINN solvers for multidimensional SDEs based on the Wiener expansion, which expresses stochastic solutions as spectral expansions in terms of a set of random basis functions. The proposed SDE PINN solver uses the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève (KKL) expansion for the Wiener process to obtain finite-dimensional approximations, effectively transforming SDEs into rough path ODEs. These ODEs can then be solved using the standard loss function formulation of PINNs for ODEs.

As a natural extension, this approach can be generalized to SPDEs using the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), which extends the Wiener expansion to handle spatially distributed noise in stochastic systems. By developing and implementing these solvers, this project aims to enhance NeuralPDE's capabilities in solving high-dimensional stochastic systems, making it a more comprehensive tool for data-driven modelling and simulation of stochastic dynamical systems.",Astitva Aggarwal,https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl/pull/956,https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/SayjRFPs

This project aims to further improve the capability of BMv2 and enable a potentially broader insight for developers to analyze their P4 program. 

While traditionally one packet only goes through one path within the switch and thus obtains only one result, there are many situations where it is more useful to have all possible outputs from a P4 simulation. For example, we use this for diff testing, to determine whether the switch is doing something correct or something incorrect.

Multiple allowed behaviors and results usually arise from various multi-path constructs (e.g. ECMP, WCMP, or perhaps LAGs) which are often modeled as action profiles/selector in P4. BMv2 currently allows users to set a mode determining action profile/selector behavior, like `round robin` where every time one sends in the same packet, it would invoke the next possible forwarding action (eventually wrapping around).

The goal of this project is to provide a new mode for BMv2 to output all possible behaviors.

Problem: Renaissance-era Spanish texts remain digitally inaccessible due to modern OCR systems' inability to process archaic glyphs (ligatures, obsolete diacritics), degraded prints, and non-standard orthography. This limits scholars’ ability to analyze historical linguistic evolution and cultural heritage.


Solution: Develop an open-source OCR system using a CNN-RNN hybrid architecture tailored for 17th-century Spanish. The model integrates weighted learning to address class imbalance (e.g., rare symbols like ſ or ç) and synthetic data augmentation to simulate historical print degradation. 


Key innovations include:


Weighted loss functions (focal loss, class-aware cross-entropy) to prioritize underrepresented characters.


Rule-based post-processing (e.g., positional substitution of ſ → s).


Synthetic training data with historical fonts and degradation simulations, alongside real data


Deliverables:


A trained OCR model achieving ≥80% character accuracy (CER ≤20%).


Evaluation metrics (CER/WER) and symbol-specific performance analysis.


Codebase with inference scripts, documentation, and sample transcriptions.


Impact: This tool will empower digital humanists, archivists, and linguists to transcribe and analyze historical texts at scale, preserving cultural heritage and enabling new research into early modern Spanish.

First, I want to clean up the code so it follows the latest rules and is easier for other programmers to understand and work on. This means organizing the codebase using the standard way Joomla! 5 builds things.

Second, I want to make sure Weblinks is really reliable. To do this, I'll be writing a lot of automated tests using Cypress. These tests will check if everything is working correctly, so we can catch and fix problems easily. I'm aiming for really good test coverage – checking almost everything important.

Third, I'll be looking at the list of problems people have reported with Weblinks and trying to fix them. This will make the tool much better for everyone who uses it.

Finally, I'll be updating the instructions and explanations (the documentation) for Weblinks. This will help people understand how to use it and help other programmers contribute to it in the future.
