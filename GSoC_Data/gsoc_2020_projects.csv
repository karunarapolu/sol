Currently, we maintain a third party repository which locks all dependencies of scancode.But we face the following problems.
a)We supported Python 2 &amp; Python 3.6. Each version of python may need a pre-built wheel if there is native code. And to add support for python 3.7, 3.8 we have to add wheels in the third party  repo of 4 variants(oses) for each dependency.<br>
b)We support Windows, Linux, macOS and possibly FreeBSD each with some possible architecture variants. For each of these we are storing a variant for each of the Python versions above.
This creates way too many wheels that end up making ScanCode checkouts very long and tarballs too big. 
Therefore i decided to improve the provision of third party dependencies to minimise the problem we facing till now.</p>

OTIO includes opentime, a library for dealing with time. In order to deal with time intervals of clips/sequences it makes sense to have operators that help with temporal reasoning. Such operators have been given by James F. Allen. The core OTIO API is written in C++. A lot of other higher level languages are popular for tooling. Many such languages (such as Lua, Go, Ruby, etc) are not directly compatible with C++ but have ways to interact with a C-API. So it would help if we have a C wrapper for OTIO. Java is one of the most versatile languages, also powering one of the most pervasive platforms - Android. Mobile Computing is becoming more powerful and widespread by the day.

One of the most important parts of an end to end small satellite business is ground-based tracking. Satellite tracking provides valuable information on the whereabouts with the use of large antennas and high power transmitters at the price of expense and lead time.</p>
<p>It is thus important to use an alternative tracking method, for example, Doppler Tracking. Doppler based orbit determination uses a doppler frequency shift to convert to a distance problem. Then, orbits may be directly fitted to the Doppler data in a trial and error fashion, but a much less laborious way of computing is to differentially correct an initial approximation of the orbit. This way the cost of the tracking system is kept low because equipment needs beyond the essential receiver are small, at a minimum consisting of an amplifier and a variable oscillator.</p>
<p>So through this project, the goal is to determine the orbit of active satellites using Doppler shift by implementing an algorithm and simulate the final results.</p>

The U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Space Operations Center processes more that 400.000 measurements daily taken by the Space Surveillance Network that includes a wide range of RF and electro-optical sensors. The catalog information can be augmented by the observations taken not only by high-end designated tracking assets, but also by cost-effective consumer-level sensors. 
While lacking high sensitivity, these sensors can still be used to perform uncued Initial Orbit Determination. Recently, in addition to electro-optical sensors, the appearance of low-cost Software-Defined Radios made it possible to deploy low-cost passive radar tracking stations. By using a network of such stations it might render possible to create and maintain an open-source orbiting object catalog. The proposed research is focused on developing software infrastructure to process measurements from multiple ground stations and perform orbit determination from Doppler observations.</p>

One of these tools is <em>spirv-fuzz</em>. It applies <em>semantics-preserving transformations</em> to a <em>SPIR-V</em> module, that we call the <em>reference</em> module, to obtain a modified <em>variant</em> module. Theoretically, a <em>semantics-preserving transformation</em> should not change the behaviour of the code. In this way, the <em>reference</em> and <em>variant</em> modules can be run, and the outputs compared. The output is usually an image. If the images differ, this probably indicates a shader compiler bug. This is a specialised form of <em>fuzzing</em> that uses a technique called <em>metamorphic testing</em>.</p>
<p>This project involved using the metamorphic testing approach to extend <em>spirv-fuzz</em> by adding new transformations to cover instructions and patterns of <em>SPIR-V</em> that were not previously covered by existing <em>spirv-fuzz</em> transformations.

In support of this, BridgeInTech brings companies involvement by allowing them to offer a Mentoring Program which mentor and mentee can work on. It is hope that this active collaboration between companies, mentor and mentee can help narrow the tech skills gap.
BridgeInTech also has another goal which is to promote equal opportunity by especially targeting those who are considered to be the minority in the industry. The categories such as gender, age, race, sexual orientation, physical/mental ability, socio economic, education, years of experience and religion, are used when getting information on user’s background. The company have an option to specify in their mentoring program the target candidates from the minority groups of the mentioned categories. It is to bring a more inclusive work environment within IT industry.</p>

Initially, I had envisioned the project with Flutter completely for cross-platform support as it suited the project idea. But along my way, working out the details and developing the sample prototype for the project idea, I got to know that ‘Landmark Detection’ from the Firebase Vision API in particular wasn’t yet supported with Flutter. To make it work, I needed to write quite good amount of native code for both Android and iOS platforms. If we were use to use on-device processing, that would make the app itself heavy since we would need to train our own custom ML model with a lot of data as an user can try to detect a monument from any angle possible. All these points, got me to reject the idea of Flutter for the complete app development. But at the same time, Flutter really has some great benefits such as extremely good UX/UI development, smooth performance, faster productive development, multiplatform support for future using same codebase. So I thought why not develop a native Android application and integrate Flutter with it for the frontend work and some backend work binding as well if needed.</p>

<p>Apertium’s existing dataset has appreciable amounts of data, which can be visualized in a graph-like structure, previously done in the Apertium RDF project (Jorge Gracia et al., 2016). In essence, each 
 pair is visualized as a ‘vertex’ on a graph, with an ‘edge’ between vertices that exist as a translation on Apertium. By exploring this graph, new translations can be inferred. In particular, bilingual dictionaries can be generated for any two languages that do not have an existing language pair but independently exist on Apertium.</p>
<p>It is notable that polysemy diminishes the use of a simple transitive relation. Apertium’s existing “Crossdics” tool follows this model.</p>
<p>My proposal will build upon the cycle density algorithm (M. Villegas et al., 2016) that defines confidence metrics in inferred edges based on cycle density. The underlying concept is that a cycle in the graph increases the confidence that vertices on the cycle are valid translation pairs.</p>

It was done using superblanks that encapsulate markup information inside them during the translation process. This works well to protect the formatting of the document. However, languages represent information differently and during translation, words/phrases move around, get deleted, split, merge, etc. The markup information on the words needs to stick with the words, otherwise we end up with erroneous markup in the translation, which is what happened:</p>
<pre><code>Spanish Input: &lt;i&gt;El perro&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;blanco&lt;/b&gt;

After modifying most modules in the pipeline to work with these wblanks, writing new de/reformatters, and adding markup in wblanks, the translation we have:</p>
<pre><code>Spanish Input: &lt;i&gt;El perro&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;blanco&lt;/b&gt;

easy update and development. The Linux Kernel Driver acts as a central entity to manage the
FPGAs, provides a JTAG interface to any application like OpenOCD to make SVF replays possible,
and essentially makes testing and debugging new code much easier.</p>

Normal maps are textures that are efficient for introducing spatial variational detail on smooth geometry. Information from the normal map, in current shading point, can be used to define either shading normal of meso-surface or microsurface profile of microfacet bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In this project, we will implement a method from Schüssler et al.  ""Microfacet-based normal mapping for robust Monte Carlo path tracing"" which tackles with microfacet based normal mapping. The result of this method enables us to use arbitrary normal maps and BRDFs for defining the microfacet BRDF for the whole surface. Important properties of the introduced microfacet BRDF are energy conservation, symmetry and discrete distribution of microsurface normals which preserves high-frequency detail.</p>

This makes the AI a perfect fit for highly demanding applications regarding CPU consumption, like media applications which have extremely strong realtime constraints. Professional audio/video studios have to guarantee for small latencies when transmitting media signals between different devices. Different media channels in a transmitted stream need to be carefully synchronized to guarantee for e.g. lip synchronicity. 
To use the AI in such a scenario, the AVB protocol stack should be implemented in the Beagleboard Linux Kernel, which allows for synchronization of media streams within a local area network. 
Furthermore the CTAG Face audio drivers should be ported from BeagleBoard-X15 and HDMI audio out capabilities should be deployed, to allow the in- and output of audio data.</p>

Volumetric soft body simulation can be used to capture the complex details of muscle and skin, e.g. volume preservation under collision/compression. In visual effects, such methods must also be robust to extreme deformation (no numerical blow-ups) and fast enough for interactive manipulation. Moreover, many of the underlying material models are nonlinear and computationally expensive, such as hyper-elastic models for realistic tissue or artistically-defined deformation. Toward these challenges I propose the implementation of a volumetric soft body solver in Blender, that is not only rapid and robust, but is general to hyper-elastic materials. The solver will also be capable of robustly resolving self-collisions and possibly other constraints. This would greatly improve the use of physics in Blender for animation pipelines.</p>

The purpose of this project is to 1) extend testing for precision of thousands of bits and 2) add arbitrary-precision support for more complicated functions and constants. This includes adding tests for arithmetic operations of higher precision, extending tests for simple functions, extending special functions to higher precision, adding support for higher precision constants (and adaptive precision algorithms) and optimising several of the operations (see Milestones for details).</p>

Its support for diverse programming languages, different access control models and the powerful adapters gains it the greatest popularity in the open source community. However, there are still lots of difficulties in utilizing Casbin at the frontend, especially applying it on the management of users’ accessibility to specific UX widgets. In the GSoC 2020, I wish to implement a friendly JS library (aka Casbin.js)  and other supported facilities to extend Casbin to the frontend development.

C++ Modules have been implemented for Unix and OS X systems already and it is expected that with next release of ROOT, C++ modules will be default on OS X. This project aims to extend the C++ Modules support for Windows, by implementing compatible solutions to the UNIX baseline and also display corresponding performance results.</p>

Current infrastructure still faces limitations to tackle the expected increase in data in terms of storage capacity and computation time. Early event reconstructions were based on matrix element methods followed by Monte Carlo techniques. Recent advances focused on boosting the speed of event simulations. For instance, C++ - based DELPHES uses simplified detector geometries and particle-material interactions, hence mapping the detector response into a parametric function. Nevertheless, this technique is limited by its exclusiveness to a specific detector geometry at a time, with any detector changes requiring the framework to be adjusted accordingly through hand-coding. Falcon (previously Turbosim), a fast stimulation framework that uses non-parametric methods to discern detector responses without the need for hand-coding. That being said, we aim to investigate the efficiency of deep generative models in simulating event reconstructions in a given detector, hence potentially replacing conventional complex algorithms.</p>

To fully utilize this feature, and to plan ahead for how new software will be deployed in the future, it is required to know what and how many Grid sites of WLCG support this feature.

In addition to that, it is important to collect the hardware and software information of the nodes in each Grid site to fully identify the facilities provided by each Grid site. At the moment, a job can be submitted manually to the Grid to retrieve system information of a node, but it is a very tedious and time-consuming task to keep submitting jobs manually until the jobs cover all the Grid sites in WLCG.

Deployment is a major part of this project and the aim is to have a seamless transition from the CPU backend to the GPU backend, with the dependent projects having to make minimal changes to accomodate for the new backend.</p>

During a run, it generates about 40 TB data per second. Since It is not feasible to readout and store such a vast amount of data, so it selects and stores only interesting events or events likely to reveal new physics phenomena. Currently, Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) with handcrafted features are used for that.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to test the performance of different deep learning algorithms and minimize the latency in inference. The best models in each algorithmic type will be wrapped into a functional prototype emulator. Other than this, a significant emphasis will be given on proper documentation.</p>

To move their large data around, CERN uses a service known as Rucio. In order for scientists to be able to perform analyses on Rucio-managed data using SWAN, it must be made accessible from within the notebook. This could be done in several ways, one of which is telling Rucio to replicate the requested data to a specific storage location. To do this, scientists must use Rucio CLI or web-based UI, which could be somewhat overwhelming for some. In addition to that, they must know which storage location the data must be replicated to, and the file path to access the data once replicated. Also, the path can change after sometime, forcing them to go through the process again.</p>
<p>To address the issue, this project aims to develop a JupyterLab extension that integrates with Rucio. It takes care of creating a replication rule and providing an easy way of getting the file path. If the data becomes unavailable, the extension can make it available again automatically.</p>

<em>Making a Separate Repository and Refactoring Simulator Code</em>:  The first part is refactoring of the simulator code base. For some time now, the CircuitVerse community has wanted to refactor the current javascript codebase (sample GitHub issues: #199, #110, #190). 
<em>Testing Simulator Code</em>:  With bug fixes and new features being implemented by a growing community of circuitverse it will be essential to test Pull Requests before CircuitVerse admins and maintainers merge them. so the second part of my proposal is adding tests to ensure the basic functionality of the simulator.
<em>Electron App</em>: CircuitVerse provides a platform to perform simulations on an online simulator that users don’t have to install, is lightweight and has a lot of features but sadly not everyone has unrestricted access to the internet. This can be one of the reasons why CircuitVerse’s maximum traffic is from developed countries with above-average or good internet connectivity like the USA(26%), India(11%), UK(6%) and Canada(4%). It would be a big step towards increasing accessibility to have an offline App. Hence, I propose the third part of my proposal: An offline electron app for CircuitVerse.</p>

Therefore, it is important to ascertain that the CI/CD tooling works efficiently with these external SCM repositories.

These tools will present the information hosted by the CDLI in a more accessible format by converting transcribed cuneiform numerals into interactive graphics with arabic numerals. This will open the data to a wider audience by reducing the need for domain expertise to interpret the data. Experts will also benefit from seeing summary statistics about the corpora and graphs highlighting trends which may not be apparent from manual inspection of the texts.</p>

<p>The discriminator is trained to distinguish real text from synthetically generated text, using the generator’s output and a human-evaluated dataset. The generator is updated by employing a policy gradient and Monte Carlo (MC) search on the basis of the expected end reward received from the discriminator model. The reward is estimated by the likelihood that it would fool the discriminator model. We envisage that this approach will result in more fluent and adequate verbalizations. It is also noteworthy that this would be a novel approach to solve the problem statement which has never been previously explored in literature. Closest available research is that of (Yu et al., 2017), however they do not rely on graphical input representations for their model, and employ an RNN based encoding module within their generator network.</p>

Kernel Crash Dumping mechanism that allows us to save the contents of the system’s memory for later analysis. The FreeBSD core dump facility preserves a copy of the contents of system memory to a special disk partition at the time of a fatal error for later debugging. This copy or “dump” can be a machine-readable form of the complete contents of system memory or just the set of kernel pages that are active at the time of the crash. The state can be recovered by saving it to a file under /var/crash. Kernel core dumps allow us to examine the state of the kernel after a kernel panic or hang. Currently, there is no automated test suite in FreeBSD to verify if all the code paths work. 
The aim of the project is to create a framework for recovering and testing those kernel dumps for a different set of configuration variables or code paths while logging every test case separately in a log file and later analyzing which code paths failed.</p>

It helps us eliminate the ambient authority problem.</p>
<p>These sandboxing techniques also have a weakness. Sometimes an unprivileged application requires access to a namespace, here Casper comes to our rescue.

FreeType is packed with a lot of complex font-related features, therefore, logging is an important aspect for this library. Freetype uses a home-brewed tracing and debugging facility which is well thought and designed but there is a limitation of this facility to write logs only on platforms that have inbuilt support for standard error. Therefore, this facility fails on platforms lacking standard error. Since FreeType is used on a variety of platforms, there is a strong need to enhance the current logging facility beyond a standard error in order to ease the development and debugging.
The idea under this project is to enhance the existing design of writing logs to standard error to writing logs to the file system considering almost all platforms support input/output to files. 
There are multiple logging libraries that are freely available in the market and are stable, which will do the job of printing logs to a file.
Hence, this project involves exploring the existing logging libraries, selecting one of them, integrating the same in FreeType and finally touching upon the testing part.</p>

In the context of fonts, each pixel in a distance field image (or bitmap) is a shortest value from that pixel's position to the nearest edge of the outline of the corresponding glyph.
Distance field is also known as distance transform and have various applications such as image processing, path-finding etc, but the main motive behind this project is to support high quality text rendering in real-time graphics applications (such as games). So, while rendering distance fields in such applications, the renderer can simply check the pixel's value and discard ones that are greater than a specific range. This makes distance fields almost infinity scalable without losing quality, this means you can use a 128x128 resolution distance transform and it will provide better quality than a 4k resolution image and will also require much less space. Moreover they can also be used to add many types of cool effects, like halos, drop shadows, bluring etc.
So, the goal of this project is to add support for generating signed distance fields from font files in FreeType.</p>

<p>FRRouting uses the concept of a data plane which is the part of the code that processes thedata requests. It is used in communication with kernel i.a. to update routing tables. There areseveral different methods for reading kernel routing table information, updating kernel routingtables, and for looking up interfaces. One of them is Linux Netlink - asynchronouscommunication between kernel and user. FRRouting with its dataplane abstraction, uses aqueue of dataplane context objects for messages waiting to be sent. A separate thread loopsover this queue and sends the context objects to the appropriate dataplane. Every singlemessage is handled and sent separately, but there’s room for improvement. Certaindataplanes allow for sending multiple messages to them at once, so we could benefit from it.This would improve overall processing time. My proposal will involve implementing one ofthe proposed ideas, namely “Dataplane Batching”.</p>

With the Data Repository Service (DRS) schema, the GA4GH has developed an API specification that provides access to data stored in the cloud, via a uniform experience. The DRS schema is part of the GA4GH Cloud Work Stream, which allows users to execute FAIR workflows on FAIR data in the cloud. However, it currently does not allow data to be dynamically added, which is a limitation to some use cases for federated computing.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop an open-source, generic (i.e., not tied to any specific data provider), distributable and highly reusable DRS microservice implementation with various, diverse and unique use cases in the operationalization of the GA4GH Cloud Work Stream, such as enabling user upload in client applications or on-site caching, temporary/intermediate storage functionality for execution endpoints and as a lightweight and maintainable demo service for GA4GH Cloud interoperability testing.</p>

While GNSS can provide us precise positions estimation, the GNSS signal can be easily affected by some error sources, for example, jamming signal in this project. 
In this project, our main hypothesis is that jamming signals can be considered as outliers (either in time of frequency domain) to the received GNSS signal. To mitigate those outliers,  robust version of cross-ambiguity functions (CAFs) are introduced with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator under heavy tailed distribution and M-estimator. Thus we can reduce the affect of jamming signals in terms of outliers and make GNSS more robust.</p>

With a plethora of different sets of governing equations, neuronal models with complex biophysical properties, synapses with plasticity and parameters, a mechanism to derive generalized platform-independent model description becomes inevitable. Further, the model description mechanism helps in easy access and reproduction of the models, and thereby exasperating reference to the platform-specific source code shall be avoided. Currently, Brian uses <code>brian2tools.nmlexport</code> package to elegantly export Brian models to <code>NeuroML</code>. However, it is confined and cannot be extended easily to various other generalized model descriptors. Therefore, the project proposes an idea to create a generalized basic framework, which can coherently describe Brian models in a standard format and shall be easily extended to various other formats. The proposed idea would substantially enhance the interfacing functionality of Brian models with other standard model descriptors and thereby helps various users and research communities.</p>

To account for the same, we aim at extending the rsHRF-toolbox  to interface between estimating region-specific resting-state HRF (rsHRF) from fMRI data, and modeling BOLD activity in TVB. The extended toolbox shall take fMRI data as input, estimate the region-specific rsHRF for regions (network nodes) defined by the connectome used in TVB, and mediate the fMRI data simulations through TVB's Bold monitor and BoldRegionROI monitor while accounting for the underlying HRF variability across the network.

It is a very convenient tool for researchers conducting neuroimaging research studies, as they are often statistically underpowered because of the difficulty to get data from enough subjects. The obvious solution to increase the datasets’ size is to collect data from multiple sites,  but using data with multiple sources needs a very high level of care to make the data collected compatible. 
Neuroscience is very interdisciplinary and not all researchers involved in the process should have to collect their own data to do what they do best. Thus, LORIS should help to reduce useless redundancy of studies, or at least put them together to make better studies.
The REST API is an easy way to securely access, retrieve and manipulate the sensitive data about the subjects stored in LORIS. The information stored in Loris is very personal to the subjects, so the security of these actions on Loris’ database is of foremost importance for ensuring the subjects confidentiality.</p>

These features and extensibility have made Inkscape the wonderful software it is today.
But, these features come with a cost, i.e. difficulty accessing these features. Currently, operations have to be searched through highly nested and huge drop-downs. Also, you have to remember where the option was. Keyboard shortcuts don't solve the problem due to their learning curve, system shortcuts, and the limit on the number of keys that can humanly be pressed.
Command Palette(CP) is an interactive search bar that can search any operation (extensions, edits, filters, etc.) that Inkscape provides. CP is also a tool for the <strong>power users</strong> It speeds up the access times by using commands that help users to bypass the slow GUI and use mostly their speedy keyboards.
Another problem is repetition. The ordered nature of most drawings calls for repetition. As we know Inkscape is a tool for creative people and nothing kills creativity faster than repetition. 
Macros are a way to record your actions and repeat them. Command Stack provides a GUI way to make macros.</p>

One is lib2geom which was designed specially for Inkscape and the other is livarot, a library written in 2003 that has some unique features which lib2geom doesn't have. Features such as: <em>path simplification</em>, <em>path flattening</em>, <em>line scanning (flowing text)</em>, <em>path offset/inset</em>, <em>boolean operations</em> and some modes of <em>tweak tool</em>. While livarot is functionally good, it's quite outdated. It was written in 2003, it's extremely hard to understand it or maintain it. The goal of this project is to implement all of these features either in lib2geom or outside it while using lib2geom's features as much as possible.</p>

<li>The second part consists in improving BookReader in order to make the framework more easily implementable outside archive.org. Currently BookReader is very book-centered, but it may find uses for other sources such as newspapers and magazines. The current number of easy-to-change parameters available in the BookReader demos and templates is quite small, and doesn’t allow great customization. This part of the project consists in improving and expanding the parameter system (included in the E2E testing).

Intrusion Detection using Elytron is aimed at doing the same i.e. to extend Elytron’s functionality. 
Intrusion Detection is the art of sensing when a system or network is being used inappropriately or without authorization. Without intrusion detection, an attacker can attempt attacks many times until an attack is finally successful. Intrusion detection allows for these attacks to be identified before a successful attack is likely to occur.  The purpose of this project is to implement an Intrusion Detection system that detects suspicious activity or a potential attack and report it to the administrator.</p>

Then studying and comparing the existing Quarkus Maven plugin source code and Quarkus Gradle plugin source code we realize where Quarkus lags behind in the case of Gradle.

The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc within the system. It does this by maintaining a local XML-based database. This leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins master. Hence, the core idea of this project is to extend Jenkins core to support storing of fingerprints in an external storage, which would be managed by storage system specific plugins. This would involve designing and creating the external fingerprint storage API. The API would also allow multiple Jenkins instances to store their fingerprints inside a single external storage instance, enabling traceability of artifacts across the CI/CD flow. The project also involves creating two plugins, as reference implementations. These plugins would allow users to store fingerprints inside their Redis and PostgreSQL instances.</p>

Due to changes in the structure of the QuickControls2, calendar is now a Marketplace component. The new goal is to update the Calendar extension and make sure that it meets all the QQC2 module standards and supports all features like styling.</p>
<p>Modularity and Simplicity is the main target of the Qt Quick Controls 2. QQC2 have a very broad scope, in that they provide a styling system flexible enough to allow the development of applications that have either a platform-dependent or platform-independent style. That is the reason that C++ is responsible for handling events and logic, and thus the performance is increased, allowing the visual QML layer to be a simple, declarative layer on top. This is of course reflected in the structure of the controls project: all visual implementations sit in the imports folder, so that developers who want to create their own complete style can do it easily. Because of the above, updating the Calendar widget to Qt Quick Controls 2 standards is something essential and will have a significant impact for the Qt users.</p>

To identify objects we use the ids that we introduced for loading dialogs from UI files. We still have unsupported items in LibreOffice UITesting Framework. Also We have a domain specific language that we used to log the events in its syntax. Also we have Logger that supports the UI elements of Visual Component Library and some application-specific events can also logged. So The project mainly goals is to Extend the ability of the existing UI testing framework to support the unsupported items that exist now. Then to Increase the ability of the DSL that used for testing by Be able to log more complex events and the events of the new added items that were unsupported before. Also Be able to generate more meaningful test cases with the DSL not just replaying the user action from the Logger. Finally to Add new generic methods for writing test cases for new bugs.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to devise and implement a simulation-ready memory controller dedicated to benchmarking processor cores implemented on field programmable logic, that will produce delays much closer to a system where the memory interface is running at a much slower clock speed.

<li>A simulation model for a memory controller that is tunable.</li>
<li>A synthesizable module to be placed between the soft core implementation and an existing non-tunable DRAM controller.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Novelty and benefits to the community</h3>
<p>So far, papers have been reluctant to provide accurate processor core performance figures extrapolated from FPGA implementation because DRAM controllers have an unrealistically high clock speed clock speed relatively to a soft core, compared to an ASIC core implementation. Providing the community with open source tunable memory controller models dedicated to the benchmarking of soft cores will greatly help producing more accurate and interpretable core  and accelerator performance figures without requiring an ASIC tape-out in the first place, which is often not even an option.</p>

The majority of the code was written in mid 2017 and does not use modern Rust asynchronous programming techniques, namely async/await. Instead, the project currently uses older asynchronous-styled code using manual combinators that have historically made maintaining (and writing) async code very difficult. This project will migrate the older futures code from 0.1.25 to std::future::Future and port all functions to using the newly introduced async/await syntax.</p>

Due to this, extensions can't be dragged into the screen designer. To work around this, extension developers have to get a reference to a visible component as parent under which they create UI views. This, however, defeats the idea of App Inventor, which allows the users to create their UI of their apps using the concept of WYSIWYG.
My proposal to solve this problem is to have a generic <code>MockVisibleComponentExtension</code> which can be dragged into the designer. The extension will be just a visible component as opposed to non-visible component. This allows the extension to be placed under a <code>ComponentContainer</code> under which the extension can create its views. This allows the users to view a clear hierarchy of their app's UI when using ""visible"" extension. Then, there will also be a need for <code>MockComponentContainerExtension</code> into which any visible component/extension can be placed.</p>

Instead of having to juggle beatmatching, effects, cues and sliders all at once, a DJ should be able to rely on his tools so he can focus on what really matters. For some, beatmatching and syncing two tracks is an art in itself - for others, including me, it is something happily delegated to the software - that is why there is a sync function.</p>

In the case of Musescore, the code was written manually for QT, with all the drawing and file handling code written manually. So the classes in libmscore follow this tree-like model somewhat informally, but not explicitly. I will be refactoring the code, such that the classes in libmscore follow this model exactly by adding a ""children"" list to the ScoreElement class. Many operations can then be written as tree traversals. This would prevent a lot of duplication in code, and simplify the code in a lot of places.</p>

Generally, Bayesian inference generates numerous datasets that represent different aspects of the model.

In some areas this is a vast oversimplification of the physical reality; light exists on a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. Spectral rendering achieves better accuracy by taking that into account. The major drawback is that it cannot use widely available color data for surfaces such as photographs. The process of gathering usable spectral data is significantly more time- and resource-intensive.</p>
<p>Spectral upsampling is the process of extrapolating spectral information from RGB color data. This is possible because, in practice, spectral reflectivities, which describe how a surface interacts with incident light on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis, tend to fit relatively simple patterns. The goal would be to add support for several newly published algorithms to Colour, a color science library for Python. With the rising popularity of spectral rendering, the library would greatly benefit from the work.</p>

It already includes an OCR that can recognize text within images, however, it lacks any functionality to describe image content and allow users to interact with the various objects within images. This project aims to overcome these issues through two modules:</p>
<ol>
<li>A machine learning module to generate descriptive captions for images on the user’s screen or those manually inputted by the user.</li>
<li>An object detection model that draws bounding boxes around recognized objects and outputs the object label when the user’s pointer enters a bounding box.
The outputs of both these modules could be presented to the user using NVDA’s existing mechanisms such as voice or braille.</li>

In more recent times, the focus has shifted on pangenomes, that encode genomic variation across multiple individuals of a certain species.
Pangenome graphs (also called Variation Graphs) are used to store and represent pangenomes. Multiple open-source tools have been developed for building and analyzing Variation Graphs and VG (<a href=""https://github.com/vgteam/vg"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/vgteam/vg</a>) is the most popular one. VG provides a framework to work with Variation Graphs, and it is currently capable of handling moderately-sized graphs. However, it has issues scaling up for large datasets.
I want to improve its performances by building a highly parallel graph explorer that makes use of GPU architecture in Rust. GPUs are well known for their ability to do millions of operations at the same time, however achieving this requires code to be written in a speciﬁc, parallel-oriented way. I think that, with help from the mentors, this can surely happen, and VG will be able to explore Variation Graphs much faster.</p>

Currently, pysradb is transitioning to phase out its dependency on an SRAmetadb.Sqlite file from the SRAdb project.

This search module should be able to take in the user’s search query, parse it accordingly, query the SRA database and then retrieve and display the search results to the user.

<ul>
<li>Accepting additional input parameters to finetune search results.</li>

Such data-sharing restrictions allow keeping privacy of the patients but at the same time it impedes the pace of biomedical research, slows down the development of treatments of various diseases and often costs human lives. 
COVID-19 pandemic is unfortunately a good illustration of how inaccessibility of clinical training data leads to casualties that can be otherwise avoided. Even the World Health Organization which is supposed to become a data hub for COVID-19 data, refuses to share most of the clinical data even in anonymous form due to the complexity of regulations. 
Such problems are also common for bioinformatics as training classifiers and regressors on patient *-omics data often involves dealing with medical records of the patients.</p>
<p>To address these problems, we propose to develop a package, HRC, which will be built on top of Federated Learning (FL) framework, to bridge the gap between healthcare provides and researchers.<br>
This package will allow biomedical researchers to quickly modify and deploy FL for typical bioinformatic use-cases.</p>

Most of the time a sample from only one organism, of which the genome (and therefore the proteasome) is known, is analyzed. In this case choosing a suitable database does not pose a problem.<br>
However if the sample contains one or multiple unknown organisms, it can be difficult to choose an adequate database. Nevertheless there are multiple approaches to solve this, but those methods frequently depend on assumptions and are therefore not guaranteed to generate a suitable database.<br>
Because of that it would be valuable to be able to score those databases. Thus ensuring the most suitable one is used.<br>
To achieve this, <em>de novo</em> sequences are derived for mass spectra and appended to the given protein database. Subsequent a standard protein search engine is run. The number of <em>de novo</em> and database sequences are counted after some false discovery rate determinations. The quality of the database can now be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>database quality = # database sequences / (# database sequences + # <em>de novo</em> sequences)</p>

Usually, electron density assigned in the atoms that constitute the molecule is a key element in this process. This partitioning of the electrons itself do not suggest any observable properties of a molecule. However, many observable features of a molecule are derived directly from the electron densities, hence motivating chemists to relentlessly improve this <em>noumena</em> step by step.
Currently, cclib can calculate some common atomic charge potential methods, including C-squared Population Analysis, Mulliken Population Analysis, and Lowdin Population Analysis. Because Mulliken Population Analysis and Lowdin Population Analysis are similar in its theory (Lowdin uses a different basis set to reduce the basis set dependence observed in Mulliken Analysis), it would be advantageous to have other modern calculation methods implemented in cclib. Some examples of the methods that can be implemented include DDEC6, Hirshfeld method, Bader analysis, ISA (through a bridge to Horton) and so on.</p>

Accurate numerical computation of these geodesics near Black Holes is paramount to advance our knowledge of the relativistic physics, surrounding these extreme gravitational objects, as the nearest stellar mass black hole is ~3000 ly away, making astronomical observations nearly impractical. Without proper astronomical reference to compare against, it is impossible to obtain data on the line profile of these celestial bodies, due to the appreciable general relativistic corrections required. In this project, we will consider two spacetime geometries, the Schwarzschild and Kerr Metrics, and implement python modules, that (1) help in solving geodesic equations, given initial conditions; (2) raytracing photons (null geodesics); and (3) help in performing some advanced simulations and visualizations, like simulating accretion flow, gravitational lensing and calculations, related to redshifted photons due to the spacetime curvature, near these bodies. We will survey the existing state-of-the-art literature and pick a performant implementation for the two geometries.</p>

There have been many sophisticated GPU backends including Cuda,OpenCL,Vulkan and Halide, these GPU backends can provide reference for porting some kernels' shader code of OpenCV GPU backend to WebGPU. 
    The concepts of pipeline and buffer of OpenCV Vulkan backend have many functions that are similar to WebGPU API, so I will try to write a library to enable emscripten to convert the used Vulkan API to WebGPU API. 
    Specifically, the mapping from OpenCV Vulkan backend to OpenCV.js using WebGPU can be roughly divided into three parts. First of all, mapping Vulkan buffer to WebGPU buffer to access the storage of WebGPU.Secondly, mapping Vulkan API calls for pipeline and command buffer to WebGPU API. Thirdly I’ll reuse Vulkan's shaders. It’s feasible to reuse Vulkan’s shader directly in Chrome. Another possible approach is using SPIRV-Cross to convert SPIR-V in Vulkan shader to readable, usable and efficient GLSL/HLSL.</p>

<p>FHIR has a detailed API for searching any kind of medical information. But the API as implemented by the FHIR module provides a very minimal search functionality for most of the resources where you can search by either only one or a few search parameters. There is no search functionality using advanced parameters like _include, _sort, _summary etc. Moreover, there are Lucene indices available for some FHIR resources and the search API for FHIR module doesn’t exploit these indices to provide a quicker search.</p>
<p>This project is aimed at improving the search API and implementing/providing support for more complex search operations. It takes into account implementing the search parameters which have already not been implemented for each of the core resources. It would make use of the Lucene index for resources where it is available. Currently, all the search results are returned by the server corresponding to the set of search parameters specified by the user. But this is not always desirable and it is more efficient to return only the top most useful results at a go and hence, this forms an important part of this project by implementing paging for the resources.</p>

The algorithm first identifies all of the connected components in the graph, then adds edges to connect those components together in a path.

The two edges added might consist of one connecting a vertex in A with a vertex in B and one connecting a vertex in B with a vertex in C.

<p><strong>Depth First Search</strong>: It is the implementation of a standard graph traversal algorithm, and has been implemented in Boost Graph Library as two different algorithms - <code>boost::depth_first_search</code> for directed graphs and <code>boost::undirected_dfs</code> for undirected graphs. One of its applications is to find a path in the graph from a source vertex to all other vertices. It has a linear time complexity of <code>O(|V| + |E|)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential Vertex Coloring</strong>: It is an algorithm to compute the vertex coloring of a graph. This involves assigning colors to the vertices of a graph sequentially in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. It has been implemented in the Boost Graph Library as <code>boost::sequential_vertex_coloring</code> for undirected graphs. One of its applications is to do a proper coloring of the graph or to check if a graph is bipartite. It has a time complexity of <code>O(|V| * (d + k))</code>, where <code>|V|</code> is the number of vertices, <code>d</code> is the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph, and <code>k</code> is the number of colors used.</p>
<p>The project also analyzes the behavior of several algorithms after ordering the input rows in a particular order.</p>

It gives users the facility to store any kind of alphanumeric data. Users are able to take photos, record their position, and view their current location on a map based on the configuration settings of their MapMint server. When the user returns back to a place with access to the internet, the recorded data can be uploaded back to the MapMint server. The aim of the project is to extend Augmented Reality (AR) support in the MapMint4ME application. The motivation for the project was to improve field data acquisition. AR Simulation module provides users capability to visualize 3D objects simulation in real world scenes. AR Area module allows users to export measured ""AR measurements"" into text format and which can be used for further analysis.

<p>With the current trend of increasing parallelism, there is a need for a uniform way of making these parallel implementations available along with the default serial ones. Currently in PCL, this has been done by providing separate classes/functions having independent APIs.</p>
<p>With the integration of execution policies and executors (part of C++23 hopefully) libraries like PCL will be able to provide a unified API to switch between different implementations. To ensure there is no sudden breakage in the existing API, a transition phase is needed to slowly phase out the old API in favour of a unified API.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>This project aims to transition the existing API to forward-compatible unified API. 
The basic details are:
Using tag dispatching to enable function overloading, allowing user to select  between different available implementations.
Lack of tags allows PCL to choose best possible implementations, this allows to maintain backward compatibility with current API.
Missing implementation for a tag raises compile-time errors
Providing SIMD/OpenMP/CUDA implementations of existing algorithms using the proposed unified API.</p>

The aim of this project is to design a scalable backend infrastructure that delivers a web interface allowing users to request new icons in an easy and intuitive way. Users can attach files with the request to explain what they want. The admins or EOS maintainers can then resolve, close and revise these requests. Even users can comment and vote for the existing requests. This can also serve as an efficient feedback and response mechanism which is critical for any organization to improve and make progress. Thus, it potentially becomes another reusable open source project for EOS.</p>

<li><strong>Make cve-bin-tool as concurrent as possible:</strong>
Use asyncio for IO bound tasks like extracting archives, downloading NVD datasets
etc. Use concurrent.futures for CPU bound tasks like scanning for version string in
input file with each checker’s version pattern regex.</li>
<li><strong>Allow users to scan CVEs from various input format:</strong>
We already have a csv2cve option to get CVEs from the csv formatted input.It would
be nice to extend this functionality for other formats like JSON and HTML.</li>
<li><strong>Allow users to divide CVEs in different categories and specify severity:</strong>
Add an option while generating user specified formats like json or csv to add each
individual CVE in one of the four categories [Not yet investigated, Confirmed,
Mitigated or Ignored] and also allow the user to specify severity for that CVE.</li>
<li><strong>Improve Documentation of cve-bin-tool:</strong>
Add documentation for different usecases of the tool like how to scan a docker image, how to scan multiple directory in parallel etc.</li>

This operating mode in QEMU is called the user mode and it is much simpler than the more commonly known system mode in which the full computer system is emulated. The user mode is useful for fast cross execution and debugging and is usually executed on Linux based systems. It achieves this cross execution by having its' own implementations of system functions from the Linux kernel interface. Although many system functions are supported in QEMU, the kernel is constantly extended by addition of new system calls. QEMU user mode can't consistently follow this kernel extension and thus many kernel functions are left unimplemented. The goal of this project is to significantly extend this QEMUs implementation of system functions so that many user programs that depend on these system calls can be safely cross executed. This projects' contribution also extends to the Linux Test Project by developing unit tests for system functions implemented within QEMU.</p>

Although various developed countries have already planned how to do it and obtained good results, many developing countries are starting with this titanic challenge. Planning biodiversity inventories involves a series of complications that derive not only from economic capacities but also from the difficulty of designing a survey system that warranties registering most species in a region. Planning adequate survey systems is challenging as not only geographical factors influence species distributions. Species distributions depend on complicated relationships between accessible areas, environmental conditions, and biotic interactions. As a survey aims to register species in a region, biotic interaction could be overlooked. However, the relationship between environmental conditions and the geographic configuration is of crucial importance when trying to identify key sites for biodiversity sampling. This project aims to create tools to consider the important role of environmental and geographic spaces when planning a biological survey system.</p>

In response to improve the stated, this project brings a new package 'testComplexity', which provides a suite of functions that will be useful for testing and thereby improving the speed (via code optimization) of various algorithms/functions in R. 
It quantifies the runtimes for an algorithm, classifies its time complexity trend, tests for an expected complexity class and plots the benchmarked results to help visually conceive the results. Additionally, other features such as quantifying memory allocations, subsequently predicting the space complexity class and classifying complexity for user-defined output parameters (apart from time/memory cases) have been implemented.

However, none, to our knowledge, have addressed the issue of robustness toward additive outliers, rather than innovations outliers. Muler and Yohai (2008) proposed two approaches to robust GARCH(p,q) model fitting to avoid bias in the parameter estimates and the preceding kind of over-estimation of volatility following isolated large outlier returns. In the first approach, parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood function using a modified likelihood function based on a bounded loss function. The second approach improves on the first by using a filter that limits the effect of an additive outlier on subsequent predictors of conditional variance. Our proposal is to implement the two approaches by exposing interfaces to a C++ library that can be called from any higher level language for estimating the likelihood functon. We will first develop an R implementation of the robust GARCH(p, q) fitting method, with application examples, and evaluate the performance of the code using as bench- marks selected simulation results from Muler and Yohai.</p>

On the web, we are comfortable with using the download managers built into our browsers which makes a download manager inside the web app a bit redundant.

Strong APA scheduler would allow higher-priority tasks to be ”dislodged” or moved among processors in order to make space for lower priority tasks that are limited by affinity constraints [1]. Consequently, this would allow RTEMS to achieve improved schedulability (i.e., lower response-time bounds).</p>

<p>1) ScummVM GUI is currently based on char size strings, so it relies on code pages. There are a <em>lot</em> of character sets and ScummVM supports a wide variety of languages. 
This means due to the multitude of codepages, we're using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary memory and performance</li>
<li>Low compatibility between different languages</li>
</ul>
<p>The main idea of the of this project is to shift GUI to Common::U32 Strings, which will make our GUI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unicode friendly, thus reducing the vast codepages just to one big codepage</li>
<li>Better compatible</li>
</ul>
<p>2) With enhancing our GUI, we're also trying to add support for RTL Languages.</p>
<p>3) ScummVM Project has Dynamic Plugins system in place, which allows lower-end platforms to be capable of running ScummVM.
However, when we detect games - these plugins are loaded one by one and the relevant detection features are called from the individual engines. Since this is very slow, the main idea of this project is to statically link detection features into the executable so</p>
<ul>
<li>Games are detected without loading of a plugin</li>
<li>Game detection is faster</li>
<li>Other parts remain as-is, so our low-end platforms will gain performance boosts</li>

We utilize a modern parallelization library, HPX, to develop the parallel solver. The goal of the proposed solution is to achieve full distribution of workload starting from mesh partition to computation of fields at mesh nodes. The following goal is achieved step by step, starting from a simple sequential implementation of 1D nonlocal diffusion. The 1D nonlocal diffusion equation is made multi-threaded to enable concurrent processing within a single node and then is extended to a 2D nonlocal diffusion equation. The 2D nonlocal diffusion equation is then made completely distributed to exploit data level parallelism.</p>

One cannot safely add or remove elements from one of these containers in one thread, whilst iterating or adding/removing in another thread without potentially catastrophic consequences (usually segmentation faults leading to eventual program failure). Currently, HPX, as The C++ Standard Library for Parallelism and Concurrency, does not have much concurrent data structure support yet. A number of libraries implementing thread-safe (sometimes lock-free) containers already exist that can be used for ideas and where code uses a boost compatible license can be integrated into HPX. In particular, LibCDS, a C++ library of Concurrent Data Structures, will be my interest as it has implemented a series of thread-safe containers using pthread.  I plan to integrate LibCDS into HPX by adding hpx light-weight threading support for LibCDS. I will provide well-written unit tests and documentation on each step of my implementation.</p>

Older SVG views have been converted to HTML5 Canvas to make a responsive user interface with enhanced interactivity. A new chart containing a histogram of primitive duration has been created to filter out intervals of a specific duration. This supplements the user experience in discovery of intervals having too long or too short duration. Interpretability of the Gantt chart has been augmented by the addition of traceback lines (from a child interval to its parent) and color highlighting which eventually helps to track down dependent and relevant intervals. The hardware performance counter values have been made more explicit by representing aggregated (minimum, maximum, average) values. The Traveler interface is now equipped with more options for explorative performance analysis, better feature detection, easier artifact isolation, and faster debugging.</p>

They are inherently tied to the target  operating system, and therefore require platform-specific work in order to deliver functional parity between different platforms. Swift is a multi-platform programming language, and having a good debugging experience in all platforms is beneficial for the language. With that in mind, I propose to improve LLDB’s support on the Linux operating system by: fixing Swift type metadata parsing for ELF objects; unifying queries of dynamic type resolution under the RemoteMirrors API; and, finally, enabling tests which currently do not run on Linux, or are marked as expected to fail.</p>

With these tools, users can fine-tune TensorFlow Hub (TF Hub) models with their new data directly via command lines and get their fine-tuned models saved for the ease of deployment, without writing any code. Specifically, in this proposed project, we will build a new tool for fine-tuning various object detectors provided in TF Hub, and another new tool for fine-tuning item embedding systems for structured data. Meanwhile, we will also extend the current tool for text-based nearest neighbor embedding indexing to image domains (e.g., nearest neighbor embedding indexing for images).</p>

I am very interested in the project <strong>Help migrate a TensorFlow library to TensorFlow 2.x</strong>. According to my understanding, the main change from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2.x is migrating from the static graph as default to the dynamic graph as default. Since using the static graph leads to lots of indirection between the code we write and the code we run, it is actually difficult to debug. However, using a dynamic graph, the code we wrote is the code we run, this helps us with debugging, profiling, etc. Thus I am very excited about contributing the migration to TensorFlow 2.x.</p>

At CVPR 2019, three dif- ferent solutions using this 3D representation were proposed (Occupancy Networks, DeepSDF, and IM-NET), and they show that this representation is better in some as- pects(e.g., accuracy, memory efficiency) than voxel grids or meshes, which are usually used in previous studies.
Nowadays, there are two major deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow and Py- Torch. Each of them has some libraries such as TensorFlow Graphics or Kaolin, which help users to use 3D models in neural networks easily. Unfortunately, none of the three works mentioned above are implemented in TensorFlow Graphics, whereas Kaolin provides their code. This is not a good situation for TensorFlow users who want to try using ""implicit 3D representations"" in their experiments or projects.
In this proposal, I propose a project to implement these three works in Tensorflow Graphics. I will also work on equipping some 3D geometry utilities to support users to handle the three baselines on the same interface.</p>

Rust makes a lot of sense for VMI for 2 main reasons: Rust is safe: considering that we are processing untrusted input from virtual machines, we cannot allow any crash or exploitation in the introspection agent.

It is likely that many Java users will migrate to higher versions, and unless JPF fully supports the new features of a higher version of Java it is unlikely to be used and adopted.</p>
<p>A crucial feature of Java 11 that needs to be urgently implemented is support for bootstrap methods that are generated and resolved at load time. These are used in Java for things as varied as string concatenation and lambda expressions. It is likely that more features of Java will take advantage of bootstrap methods as we go forward, so it is desirable to have a complete bootstrap method resolution engine in the JPF runtime that complies with the Java Virtual Machine 11 (JVM 11) specification for JPF to remain current.</p>

This is a novel kind of recurrent neural network with a randomly connected hidden layer, called the reservoir, and an adaptable output layer trained using a simple regression algorithm. This architecture has the advantage of faster computation and presents less parameter tuning then a standard neural network. Since their inception there has been a lot of effort towards the improvement of the model and applications have been found in several fields of study: anomaly detections in geophysics , short term predictions in astrophysics and reconstruction of chaotic attractors among others.</p>

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have greatly increased productivity of probabilistic modelers, allowing practitioners to focus on modeling, as opposed to the implementing algorithms for probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian) inference. Turing is a PPL developed entirely in Julia and is both expressive and fast due partly to Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler being implemented in LLVM.  Consequently, Turing has a more manageable code base and has the potential to be more extensible when compared to more established PPLs like STAN. One thing that may lead to the adoption of Turing is more benchmarks and feature comparisons of Turing to other mainstream PPLs. The aim of this project is to provide a more systematic approach to comparing execution times and features among several PPLs, including STAN, Pyro, nimble, and Tensorflow probability for a variety of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models, which are a class of models that provide a much modeling flexibility and often allow model complexity to increase with data size.</p>

PaStA has a lot of potential applications and use cases. A patch stack is a set of changes that modifies a body of code. Open source development is driven by applying patch stacks to an existing codebase. PaStA helps to analyse them and groups patches based on their similarity. A number of open source projects ( eg. the Linux kernel ) leverage mailing lists to support their development. All communication happens on these lists and contributors send patches to the lists for the maintainers to review. Given a mailbox of such a project PaStA can also map upstream commit references to corresponding patches in the mailbox. One of the major goals for PaStA has been to integrate with Patchwork. Patchwork is a web based patch tracking system. It helps both contributors track the state of their patches and maintainers efficiently review patches. As a first step PaStA can be used to automate the process of adding related patches to a patch on Patchwork. The primary goal of this project is to complete PaStA’s integration with Patchwork.</p>

But these interfaces are manufacturer-dependent, and hence automation scripts need to be written separately for different printers. Also, local print queues are managed using local printer tools, while administration interfaces run on browsers. To eliminate these issues, PWG introduced IPP System Service Standard which uses IPP requests to poll printer capabilities and configure the printer, thus providing a universal solution for IPP-compliant printers.</p>

For example, for non-IPP network printers the user perhaps has to enter the IP address manually, or the printer driver can have configurable options that cannot be described in IPP attributes, or a Printer Application which clusters printers have to be told which printers to actually cluster.
The solution suggested is to use a standard, i.e. IPP System Service that can define configurable parameters that a device-independent client can poll from the IPP server and display in a GUI so that the user can change them appropriate to his needs.
In this project, I aim to use IPP System Service binding to get configurability in the printer applications.</p>

Typically, compilers achieve this by running the standard optimization pass pipelines. However, customized sequences of passes for a particular program can significantly improve the performance compared to the standard optimizations.</p>
<p>So it is important to study the dependencies between these optimizations passes, and how they affect the code structure. This will pave the way to improve the existing heuristics for ordering the compiler optimization passes; heuristics that can select the optimal pass order depending on the code structure.</p>
<p>Another interesting approach is to use machine learning to optimize the compiler rather than rely on heuristics. Making machines learn how to optimize the compiler, is a faster approach to produce target-specific optimizations for the underlying platform, as well as for the code structure. For instance, machine learning can be used to identify patterns in code structure and then select the ideal optimization sequences specific to those patterns to get high performance for that program.</p>

One of the main problems that needs to be solved is the long time (latency) that it takes to move data from the computer’s main memory to the device’s memory. Therefore, using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, the proposed solution consists of adding a new functionality to the current OpenMP interprocedural optimization pass, OpenMPOpt, such that the OpenMP runtime calls that involve host to device memory transfers are split into “issue” and “wait” functions. The “issue” function will contain the code necessary to transfer the data from the host to the device in an asynchronous manner, returning a handle in which the “wait” function will wait for completion. The “issue” and “wait” functions will be moved upwards and downwards respectively, until it is illegal to do so. Doing this, the instructions between the “issue” and the “wait” can be executed, while separately doing the data transfer to the device, hence, reducing the time the process is blocked waiting for the transfer to finish.</p>

Currently, in all the mobile applications of Mifos, a lot of repeated code is present that does the job of interacting with the Fineract APIs. The motivation behind the project is to abstract all the code that interacts with Fineract Platform APIs and move it into a separately maintained library.</p>
<p>During GSoC, I worked on designing, architecting and implementing the library. The project also contains an App Module that demonstrates how to use the library in Android Applications. Further, I worked on integrating Swagger Codegen in Apache Fineract Project that would allow us to generate any client library as per our requirements. Towards the end, I also published the library for Android.</p>

<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>In this project I am willing to work on an Interactive experience for the contributor which will take them through all the possible paths according to his/her interests for the contribution journey in the terasology project.</p>
<p>Currently, there are a lot of modules in terasology and the documentation is distributed in forms of wikis, tutorials,forums, etc. and It is a bit Intimidating for a newbie (as a contributor or gamer) to understand the file structures &amp; workflow. So, I am targeting to remove this obstacle for new contributors by implementing an Interactive web experience as a <strong>Tutorial Journey</strong> with the help of vector graphics &amp; implement a system where all the steps &amp; documentations will integrate together to simplify the experience for the contributors as well as enthusiast gamers. It will be guiding the new contributor to reach the required resources in which they are interested. The end goal is to deploy a web app having a stepwise guide to follow for newbies.</p>

Since this adds different traits to different varieties of plants or any entities that have genetics, it creates a fun and immersive experience for a player to find desirable varieties of the entities he needs to craft ideal food sources from superior ingredients. The project also aims to enhance certain gameplay elements like cooking, health, and thirst to work with genetics to provide a good point of interaction between the player and genomes.</p>

This will be made possible by incorporating an element of body temperature in the game. The body temperature comes into play in the climatically extreme biomes namely- Desert and Snow.
The players will suffer some consequences should they choose to traverse these biomes without any preparation. To explore these biomes the player will have to look for ways to overcome these obstacles. However, these ways will not be present so readily. The players will have to look for these ways in other biomes. This will be made possible by some other enhancements in the form of additional items such as Wool Armor, Arabic Thawb, Water skins, Sand Slippers and an additional feature- hunting with traps. 
Players who are up to the challenge to explore the extreme biomes despite the obstacles  would have something to look forward to. Certain surprise structures namely Oasis for the Desert and Igloos for the Snow will be incorporated which would also be beneficial to the players in avoiding the extreme conditions.</p>

WebdriverIO v6.0 was released just a few days back, while it's previous version, v5.0 was released in early December 2018. However, many of MediaWiki's repositories use v4.0 which has now been deprecated. WebdriverIO v6.0 brings with it a number of internal improvements that speed up test execution with lower CPU and memory usage. Upgrading to the current version would therefore be very beneficial. For this, a stepwise approach must be devised to first upgrade all repositories to v5.0 and then ultimately to v6.0.</p>

Smack currently establishes connection between Server and Client using TCP and BOSH. BOSH suffers from high transport overhead as compared to TCP. Also various issues with long polling are suggested to have an impact upon BOSH based systems [RFC 6202 Section 2.2]. WebSocket provides an alternative to the limitation of inefficient communication between the server and the client by providing bi-directional, full-duplex, real-time client/server communications. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP [RFC 6455]. Adding WebSocket support to Smack will allow it to establish a continuous Client-Server connection with less overhead.</p>

The overall aim was to provide an experience similar to the web app, both in terms of features and stability.</p>
<p>Areas I worked on included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding support for rendering new markdown elements.</li>
<li>Developing the 'share from other apps feature' - this also involved working on Kotlin to develop Android-native features and interacting with the React Native bridge.</li>
<li>Improving the architecture of some regions of the app, such as the edit message state.</li>
<li>Fixing several high-priority bugs and making UI improvements.</li>
