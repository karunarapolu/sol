It takes JSON files as an input which is the output of ScanCode-toolkit as well. When comparing files, it only uses the exact comparison. By exact comparison, I mean it compares the hash value of the files. The output of DeltaCode is a JSON/CSV file which includes the details of the scan such as delta score, delta count, etc. The goal of this project is to improve the usefulness of the delta by also finding files that are mostly the same (e.g. quasi or near duplicates) vs. files that are completely different. After this project, DeltaCode would be able to detect similar files in a directory approximately.</p>

A system can be considered complex when its consisted of more sub-systems and when nonlinear interactions between its various design parameters and sub-systems are present. Optimizing such systems can be a challenge for human designers who can neither directly identify optimal design points nor manualy investigate a large design space to identify optimal solutions. In order to tackle this problem, algorithmic optimization approaches are required. Genetic algorithms can successfully navigate a large and nonlinear design space but their performance is highly dependent on the selection of various hyper-parameters. At its current form the optimization problem is concerned with the design of an electric propulsion unit for small satellites. This project aims in the development of visualization tools that will aid in better understanding such complex optimization processes. By developing visualization tools for the optimization process and the sub-systems' characteristics the algorithm's performance can be further enhanced and new insights that can prove valuable for human designers can be identified.</p>

The tool applies the metamorphic testing technique that transforms shaders using the available functions in OpenGL shading language (GLSL). Currently, GLSL built-in functions are not fully supported by the tool. Providing a new set of GLSL features to GraphicsFuzz would create new ideas of transformation, and help the tool to detect a wider range of bugs.</p>

Among its tools are a shader generator, which mutates a shader program into variants that differ in machine code, but render a similar image to the original - and a shader reducer, which reduces shader code to focus on specific logic that a user is interested in. Used in tandem, these tools allow one to fuzz test shader compilers for flaws and easily reproduce them.</p>
<p>The generator mutates a shader by performing ""transformations"" on the original code which complicate control/data flow. These transformations often make use of OpenGL's built-in functions and features to mutate expressions into equivalent forms.</p>
<p>However, the generator and reducer are only aware of a subset of the OpenGL shader language, and do not support all of OpenGL's built-in math and transformation functions. This reduces the number of potential mutations and ultimately hampers GraphicsFuzz's capability of finding edge cases.</p>
<p>This project aims to enhance GraphicsFuzz's support for OpenGL semantics and extend its capabilities with new transformations, then apply them to open-source drivers.</p>

<p>This proposal is about core optimisations and addition of new and exciting features to the user experience of the React application. That implies, using Server-side Rendering for faster page loading times (significantly low Time To First Byte), using web-sockets for real-time updates for incidents, comments and HTTP Long Polling for upvotes etc., migrating to more robust, scalable and available database solution, finally, decoupling it from Django views. Then we need to write consistent tests to validate different models and fields. Finally, an NFSW image classifier. Eventually, we will end up with cleaner code, sound application architecture of both frontend and backend, adding more tests and developing/revamping new features are the most obvious ones. This will not only make developing new features much more easier, cleaner and maintainable but will also dramatically improve user experience and take it to next level.</p>

The ease of access should also increase the Apertium's User Base.</p>

One of the most challenging parts of developing models based on transducers is how to weight the edges so that finally a certain path is favored over the other.</p>
<p>The obvious technique is to build a manually annotated corpus, use it to estimate probabilities and then apply these estimates to the edges as weights.However, building a large annotated corpus is in most cases a tiresome job.
Therefore, the project aims at generating these weights using only a set of raw corpora based on unsupervised techniques.</p>

The ability to autonomously detect a power failure and safely execute an autorotation will add a greater level of redundancy to the ArduCopter firmware.  This will aid in making traditional helicopters safer to operate, reducing the risk of harm/damage to people, property, and the unmanned vehicle itself.<br>
My secondary goal is to develop the functionality without loss of generality, maintaining its applicability to all helicopters.
Contained within this proposal is a review of previous work done by others.  Following this, preliminary investigations show that main rotor head momentum is a critical factor.  A methodology is proposed to scale a generic velocity trajectory using the main rotor head momentum in hover.  The trajectory will be empirically determined through SITL and real-life testing.  The resulting flight mode will provide a robust approach to completing an autorotation manoeuvre for any helicopter.  An overview plan of how development time will be allocated, over the GSoC period, is presented.  Finally, a short section detailing my background follows.</p>

One of these is user-drawn profiles, which is a commonly requested feature that is somewhat separate from the main functionality of the bevel operation, which makes it a good candidate for a GSoC project.

major changes.
A lot of research has been done in adaptive cloth simulation (which is the next big step towards
being able to do realistic cloth simulation in reasonable computation time). By introducing adaptive
cloth simulation into Blender, we can decrease the computation time per frame, thereby leading to a
better quality of simulation in the same amount of time. Furthermore, it would then be possible to
build really powerful cloth production pipelines. The current cloth production pipeline is slow and
requires a lot of user interaction (for example, for adding the correct level of topology and
redefining the stitches each time the topology changes). With the introduction of adaptive cloth
simulation, the algorithm can automatically determine the necessary topology to get the correct
collisions and realistic folds and wrinkles. Additionally, this project would act as the base for future
improvements, such as adding contact friction and dynamic tearing of cloth.</p>

<h4>Modifying (Smart) Expression Templates</h4>
<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>This proposal aims at improving the efficiency of the expression templates that are used by <code>boost::numeric::ublas::tensor</code>. Traditional Expression templates are efficient but Klaus Iglberger showed in his <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1729"" target=""_blank"">work</a> that traditional ETs (Expression Templates) does not automatically result in faster execution of the expression. Smart expression templates are a tool for capturing the expression, possibly transforming and evaluating the expression. For better expression evaluation I will use  <a href=""https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/yap.html"" target=""_blank"">Boost.YAP</a>, a C++14 and later expression template library. Boost.YAP already offers a lot of functions and algorithms for dealing with expressions. It will ease my task moreover most of the issues pointed out in the paper cited above are efficiently handled by YAP. Hence, this proposal aims at the integration of Boost.YAP for convenient expression template transformation and evaluation in <code>boost::numeric::ublas::tensor</code></p>

However, there is still much to be done to get to a peer review ready state. I propose to optimize the memory usage of Real. By changing the way real_explicit stores numbers, we can reduce memory usage of real_explicit by an order of magnitude. Utilizing std::variant, we can reduce the memory used by a real number to that of either a real_operation, real_explicit, or real_algorithm. I propose to better the way Real deals with operations, in particular, by simplifying sums of multiples of the same number. Further, I propose to implement benchmarking using Google Benchmark, to allow direct comparison between Real and other representations. After this, Boost.Real may be ready for peer review.</p>

It allows industrial designers and graphics enthusiast to create CAD projects of the highest standard and precision. With this precision and standard comes the need of high quality and accelerated rendering to visualise a document. LibreCAD 3 was designed to have multiple rendering engines without major modifications to its core. 
Right now LibreCAD 3 uses Cairo for rendering. For users with high resolution screens, Cairo is not convenient because of a slowness, due to a bad integration with Qt and a missing caching system. At each frame when rendering is done the data is sent from CPU to GPU which is very inefficient.
OpenGL has lower CPU overhead for draw calls and state changes and lets you take advantage of the GPU to render graphics on your device's screen and performance is excellent.
The project consists of replacing Cairo with OpenGL in LibreCAD 3.To make a complete well abstracted OpenGL implementation  with C++ for the rendering in LibreCAD.</p>

Our main goal here is to train a deep learning model in python using all of its symptoms for the prediction of early onset of sepsis.

The application should be able to make these predictions using only a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real-time.

The primary method through which this synchronization will be done is through syllabic analysis. Applications exist where the number of syllables spoken in an audio file can be extracted without processing the words themselves, resulting in much faster runtimes. By similarly analyzing the number of syllables in a chunk of text, a process for which several very good algorithms exist, we can roughly match the timestamp of each syllable in the audio file to the corresponding syllable in the lyrical text. This process would take place in a separate module than the actual SwagLyric application so as to facilitate speed of retrieval when the user is actually streaming. Several obstacles, which will be discussed in more detail, exist: these include stripping away background music and getting specific audio information from Spotify’s stream.</p>

Not only is a Kalman Filter more reliable about predicting future state than traditional extrapolation techniques, It also provides a confidence for the estimate. A Kalman Filter is used both to reduce the impact of sensor noise on estimations, and to determine which sensors can be “trusted” more than others. Whereas more primitive methods for estimation and extrapolation rely on some form of averaging, a Kalman Filter forecasts by developing a weighted covariance for each sensor input.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to implement a Kalman Filter in Rust. Rust has gained popularity for providing more compile-time checks than other systems-level languages, namely C and C++. Rust’s memory model ensures that there is little to no room for many of the memory pitfalls common in other low level languages, such as double-freeing memory, dangling pointers, and user-after-free errors. This, in conjunction with high runtime performance, leads writing components of a codebase in Rust to be favorable for both speed and stability.</p>

instead of edge collapsing as the primitive operation. In their method, they collapse vertices that share an edge or that are close to each other.

Thereby, the user can obtain as good results as necessary for the applications at hand within a fast and efficient pipeline.</p>

The goal of this project is to create a generic API for the global regularization algorithm, given a set of arbitrary input items, a connectivity among them, and user-defined regularization conditions. The 2D regularization technique described in KIPPI becomes a particular instance of this generic API with the items being 2D lines/segments, the connectivity being a Delaunay triangulation of these items, and the regularization conditions described in the paper. As required, I will write and include all necessary documentation, examples, and tests. This proposal describes the project requirements, anticipated constraints, and the development schedule. I have also included personal information in regards to my academic background and my commitment to CGAL.</p>

Primary issue is bloat of irreclaimable memory due to pipe-pages. Pipe buffers are pinned in memory making them non swappable. Pipes have maximum size restriction, so there could be many pipes which results in memory pressure during pre-dump process. Replacing pipe-pages with userspace supplied buffer from CRIU will alleviate this memory pressure. Since, the buffer pages can be swapped out.</p>
<p>Another issue is duration for which pre-dump algorithm freezes the target task. Use case like live migration expects smallest possible freezing glitch. So, objective is to reduce this freeze time during pre-dump.</p>
<p>To achieve both of these objectives, we use process_vm_readv system call with a set of VMA-list gathered by freezing target task for minimal amount of time. There are challenges in handling memory areas with this approach, like race conditions resulting in false reads. Development of graceful solution for these challenges is objective of this project.</p>

I would like to use Basic Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Machine Translation Problem both encoder and Decoder will be implemented using RNNs (specifically LSTM and GRU units) where Input encoded sentence along with previously learned word embedding as vector will be given to encoder which generates a fixed length context vector, Decoder takes that vector and will generate target language translation.
But it performs poorly with longer sequences sentences, to overcome this problem we will improve it with attention-based encoder-decoder model.

It has attracted a lot of attentions in the research areas of natural language processing and information retrieval. Generally, it complete the analysis challenge via three steps: identifying named entities, detecting predicates and generate SPARQL queries. In these three steps, predicate detection, a core component of this process, identifies the KB relation(s) a question refers to. To build a predicate detection structure, we identify all possible named entity first, then collect all predicates corresponding to the above entities. What follows is to calculate the similarity between problem and candidate predicates using a Multi-granularity neural network model(MGNN). To find the globally optimal entity-predicate assignment, we use a joint model which is based on the result of entity linking and predicate detection process rather than considering the local predictions (i.e. most possible entity or predicate) as the final result.</p>

Entity linking is a process of ontology alignment or ontology mapping between source and target ontology. In this workflow, the goal is to detect similar concepts/classes or instances/individuals between the source and target ontology. There are two levels of linking, the first one is schema level linking and another one is instance level linking. Schema level linking is mapping/alignment between concepts/classes of the source and target ontology and on the other hand, instance level linking is mapping/alignment between instances/individuals of the source and target ontology.</p>
<p>This proposal presents an approach for ontology alignment through the use of an unsupervised mixed neural network. In this workflow, we will explore reading and parsing the ontology and extracting all necessary information about concepts and instances, generating semantic vectors for each entity with different meta information like entity hierarchy, object property, data property, and restrictions and designing User Interface based system which will show all necessary information about the workflow.</p>

Especially in heavy rain, rain streaks from various directions accumulate and make the background scene misty, which will seriously influence the accuracy of many computer vision systems, including video surveillance, object detection and tracking in autonomous driving, etc. Therefore, it is an important task to remove the rain and fog, and recover the background from rain images. It can be used for image and video processing to make them clearer and it can be a preprocessing method for many computer vision systems. We propose to implement this technology in FFmpeg. For video, this proposal proposes to utilize the relationship between frames to remove rain and fog. For single image, we can use traditional methods, such as discriminative sparse coding, low rank representation and the Gaussian mixture model. And also some deep learning methods.</p>

Being a NodeJS powered framework specifically designed to create desktop apps, Electron happens to be the right choice for the job. While shifting to Electron, we will re-implement the existing functional / broken features ( all the tools available in PSLab desktop are not functioning as of now, which I have verified using a physical hardware ), redesign the UI /  UX flow, and take a more modular approach for development. At the core of the app, we will still use the PSLab-python library for device communication. As Electron apps are developed using JS, we can expect a more enthusiastic developer crowd to join the cause. A much more thorough documentation for the same is also available. Making use of Electron will also allow us to cherry pick modern looking UI libraries to give our user base a much more fluid experience. Finally I would make use of the easy to use packaging system of Electron so that users can easily install PSLab desktop with a single click instead of using the current install scripts.</p>

Currently the connection between a client node and the gateway are established via IPIP (IPv4/6 over IPv6), which is unencrypted and therefore possibly readable by attackers. As mesh networks usually operate on unencrypted wireless connections, the attack vector is considerably big.</p>
<p>Our solution is to combine the current cryptographic stack of BMX7 with the one used by WireGuard. The process via which this will be achieved will be iterative; meaning that first binary calls from bmx7 to userland WG will be introduced, afterwards the efforts will be centered in the creation of a new plugin implementing WireGuard routing by using part of the existing cryptographic primitives and at last the effort to combine the tunnel plugin with the wg one.</p>
<p>The detail that distinguishes our approach’s difficulty from hard to medium is cryptographic keys. It’s simpler to announce new public keys for WireGuard and have a separate plugin than replacing the existing BMX7 keys to allow signing of descriptive updates and encryption of traffic.</p>

The main indicator is the bandwidth, but also other values can be useful like latency, number of active users for each node, load average and RAM consumption of each node.
The value of these quantities can vary greatly between the peak time and the night time, for this reason some of the measurements should be carried on in both these two moments.
Some other measurements, which can affect the user experience, could instead be run just in the night time.
To identify the night time we can’t relay on the router’s internal clock which could be years away from the actual time.
So a method for getting the network-wide peak time will be sought.
Each router in the network should separately run these tests, and for avoiding to influence each others’ results they should run at different times.
This synchronization should be possible taking advantage of the LibreMesh architecture and the shared-state service.</p>

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) make up the majority of the non-coding transcriptome. Understanding the significance of this RNA world is one of the most important challenges faced in biology today, and the lncRNAs within it represent a gold mine of potential new biomarkers and drug targets. Its discovery is still at a preliminary stage.
To date, very few lncRNAs have been characterized in detail. However, it is clear that lncRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, and lncRNAs are thought to have a wide range of functions in cellular and developmental processes. There are many specialized lncRNA databases (like RefSeq, GENCODE, Ensembl, SGD, tair). We will use Machine Learning techniques to highlight and compare two sets of calls (of Ensembl / GENCODE and RefSeq) and determine which calls are incorrect.
Goal of the Project: Implement a machine learning model (a 2nd pass filter) which will predict / validate credible calls (true positive/false positive cases) produced by RefSeq and GENCODE (or Ensembl).</p>

The only way to do this now is by using empi from the science overlay and empi has its shortcomings such as lack of multilib support and was not ported to the main tree. In my proposed plan, a new MPI framework ported from existing MPI applications is introduced to enable Gentoo to use multiple MPI versions and relevant packages depending on them (for example, HPL). The new MPI framework is mainly based on ‘Modules’ package together with Gentoo Prefix technique for detecting, choosing or manipulating MPI environment. Also, a new implementation of mpi.eclass is introduced and the packages can still be emerged normally onto the system without any trace of mpi.eclass being used. The approach also enables users to easily work with different implementations at the same time without any special privileges. In order to solve the defect that empi does not support multilib, the new framework also adds support for allowing the environment to be configured and installed into different places among different architectures (amd64, x86 etc.).</p>

The motivation behind this are the complaints from developers experiencing slow Git commands when working with large repositories, such as chromium and Android. And since nowadays, most personal computers have multi-core CPUs, it is a natural step trying to improve parallel support so that we can better use the available resources.</p>
<p>With this in mind, pack access code is a good target for improvement, since it’s used by many Git commands (e.g., checkout, grep, blame, diff, log, etc.). This section of the codebase is still sequential and has many global states, which should be made local, removed or protected before we can work to improve parallelism. That's what this project is targeting.</p>

The major problem with supporting all the operations is because of the difference in how POSIX systems handle files whereas how a database-backed system like Google-Drive handles files. This difference results into limitations as to what operations can be performed with the current libgdata API. Since, each file’s identifier is its ID, i.e. “name” equals ID, we have to specifically use “display-name” for storing a file’s title, which is what is shown by nautilus.</p>
<p>Simply copying/moving files from one folder to other folder results into an error “Operation not supported” so as to preserve the file’s title. Copying/Moving is one of the fundamental operations that should be possible on a file. My ultimate goal with this proposal is to add support for this necessity and make the Google-Drive backend more usable.</p>

To support GTK in Rust, the gtk-rs project has provided great tools for creating bindings using the glib object model.

Right now in BeiDou signals, GNSS-SDR fully supports BeiDou B1l and BeiDou B3I.
The primary goal of this project is to make the software receiver compatible with the BEIDOU B1C signals. This project will enhance the software receiver to aid acquisition and tracking of BEIDOU B1C signals that would further expand the receiver's capabilities and would facilitate research on multi-constellation, multi-frequency receiver working with real signals. The demodulation of the B-CNAV1 navigation message of BEIDOU B1C will open the door to innovation in multi-constellation receivers.
Along with the fully functional implementation of a GNSS receiver working with BEIDOU B1C signals, this project will help to address topics such as integrity, reliability, robustness, enhanced coverage, and high-accuracy positioning. Additionally, the integration of BEIDOU B1C observables into the position, velocity, time (PVT) solutions will allow the achievement in a diverse range of applications and components.</p>

The performance obtained with such architectures is sufficient for benign propagation scenarios, but typically deliver poor performance under harsh propagation conditions. Code and carrier tracking, as well as joint code/carrier synchronization, can be formulated as an estimation problem which can be solved using Bayesian filtering methods. It has been shown in the GNSS literature that KF-based synchronization solutions can be used to overcome the performance limitations of standard approaches, offering implicitly adaptive filter bandwidth, and opening up the possibility of using nonlinear models to avoid certain limitations associated with the use of code, phase or frequency discriminators. In this contribution, we will leverage powerful nonlinear tracking algorithms, including cubature, unscented, and sigma point Kalman filters in order to produce realizations of carrier and joint code-carrier tracking blocks which promise to be more effective and adaptable in challenging GNSS environments when compared to traditional architectures.</p>

<p>Briefly about goals:</p>
<h4>Acyclic graphs</h4>
<p>I finished up with this draft of definition for algebraic acyclic graphs:</p>
<pre><code class=""lang-Haskell"">data AcyclicGraph a = Empty
                    | Vertex a
                    | Overlay (AcyclicGraph a) (AcyclicGraph a)

                    deriving (Eq, Show)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the vertices of graph are splitted into ""levels"" and equal vertices from different levels are considered different. In my proposal, I show how one can deal with such definition and do some basic dynamic programming. I also made up instances for basic data classes, from Functor to MonadPlus.</p>
<h4>Algorithms for edge-labelled graphs</h4>
<p>Nothing special about that, I discussed common graph algortihms for weigted graphs, choosed which of them should be implemented and even drafted implementations of some of them.</p>
<h4>Advanced graph algorithms</h4>
<p>I started with discussion of algorithms for network flows and continued with special algorithms for bipartite graphs. Many of them are easily derived from other algorihtms' implementations.</p>

My project aims to implement a library that can solve for Chebyshev polynomials.
For complex mathematical functions, Chebyshev polynomials allow us to compute perform operations such as differentiation, integration, and solutions of ODEs with both greater speed and the same numeric accuracy as when dealing with the original functions.
In this project, I hope to implement a Chebyshev polynomials module, along with the appropriate documentation, residual functions to validate the approximations, and test cases. 
The functions associated with the Chebyshev polynomials will be able to be used alongside the rest of the existing hmatrix library. I will also integrate the Accelerate language, an embedded language built to allow high-performance parallel arrays for Haskell. This library naturally fits into this project, because it allows for quick computations on large multi-dimensional arrays. Numerical algorithms are often used to solve large systems of equations, that are easily converted into large matrices of data.</p>

<p>While attempting to segment cells from High-Resolution time-lapse movies of Embryogenesis, the used unsupervised algorithms like Intensity thresholding, Watershed Transform, Active Contours, etc, which depend on extracted local or global features, fail to be resistant against uneven illumination, optical noises, complex cellular shapes and more of such distractions.

Also, the work done on Intermine cloud can easily be translated to simplify the creation of Intermines locally.

In bioinformatics, many file formats are used for storing DNA and protein sequence information.
Each file format has a formal specification and parser can be made by following the specification rules, But as most file formats are just simple text file that can be easily edited by anyone so its quite easy to make mistake and people may not comply with the standards while creating/editing file, that can lead to errors while parsing/or using that data.</p>

It will provide a generic validation library that can be further extended for any number of file format, A user can even provide its own validation implementation if he/she customize the behavior of the library.</p>

In the current implementation of KDE Partition Manager, all the privileged tasks such as executing some external program like btrfs, sfdisk etc. Or copying a block of data from one partition to the other, which requires escalated permissions to execute are executed by a helper non GUI application. So, instead of running whole GUI application (KDE Partition Manager) as root or superuser, a helper non GUI application is spawned which runs as root and executes privileged tasks. This helper program communicates with KDE Partition Manager over simple DBus protocol. The current implementation may seem a good idea, but is not, the reason being that KAuth is an extra layer added over Polkit-qt which causes extra overhead.
 So, the proposal for this project is to port all the authentication/authorization code from KAuth to Polkit-qt without effecting the original behaviour of KDE Partition Manager.</p>

SDDM used in conjunction with Plasma, however, results in certain issues, some of which fall under the guise of consistency between the login screen and the desktop. In practice this means that as soon as there is any relevant veering from Plasma defaults, the login manager no longer provides an identical visual experience. This GSoC project would try to solve that very issue by adding the possibility of syncing the desktop and login manager options. Options that could be synced are: color scheme, font, font size, font rendering, icon theme (obtained from the Plasma theme). Rather than adding discrete options, the suggestion is to have only one option that would pertain to syncing SDDM settings with a particular user’s settings. Patching SDDM to support Plasma wallpapers would also fall within the scope of the project.

<p><strong>What does the titler tool do?</strong>  : The titler tool is used to create clips containing text and images, which can be composited over videos.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong>: The titler tool renders XML using an MLT module which uses QGraphicsView. QGraphicsView is considered deprecated. Moreover, adding features to the current back end is difficult and is known to be buggy.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong>:  Rewrite the tool's backend using QML and QQuickRenderControl by implementing a new QML MLT module which can render QML frames, and to also create a basic titler which can render basic QML templates.</p>
<p><strong>Why QML?</strong>: QML, in general, allows creating powerful animations with ease and flexibility which means new features can be added to the titler.</p>

However, KIO-unaware applications are unable to interact seamlessly with KIO Slaves. For example, editing a file in gdrive:/ in LibreOffice will not save changes to your Google Drive. One potential solution is to make use of FUSE, which is an interface provided by the Linux kernel, which allows userspace processes to provide a filesystem which can be mounted and accessed by regular applications.

These attributes are used in optimizations to decide whether a particular transformation is valid or not. Functions attributes can be either given by the frontend or be inferred by LLVM. There are some attributes which can not be inferred now. If we could infer them, more optimization would be done.
In addition to this, there are a lot of problems in current implementation. First of all, each algorithm is very similar but implemented separately. If we extend these implementations to infer other attributes, there would be a lot of code duplication and it is hard to maintain consistency. Therefore, it is better to replace them with a more designed implementation. We have a new framework for deducing attribute called “Attributor” developed by Johannes Doerfert. So I propose to extend this framework and deduce attributes.</p>

This is true both in standard compilation but also link-time-optimization (LTO) in which the module is (partially) merged with others in the same project at link time. LTO is able to take advantage of this to optimize functions calls to outside the translation unit. Code compiled without LTO for all of its dependencies, however, does not have this information and therefore is unable to perform such optimizations. To remedy this issue, one might propose always compiling programs with LTO enabled. This doesn’t solve the problem for two reasons of practicality: LTO comes with a nontrivial compile-time investment; and many libraries upon which a program could depend, do not ship with LTO information, simply headers and binaries. In this project, we propose solving the problem by generating annotated versions of the source code that also include this derived information. Such an approach has the benefits of both worlds: allowing optimizations previously limited to LTO without running LTO and only providing headers.</p>

Its core essentially interprets C, C++, Objective C or Objective C++ code, and at several program points allows it’s modules, or checkers to emit reports. Later, it will construct a bug report, that shows how the error can be reproduced. These steps (such as that the analyzer modeled a call to function, assumed a variable is positive, etc.) are collectively referred to as a bug path. Ideally, this contains every information needed to reproduce the error, but is minimal. However, it can contain either too little or too much information.</p>
<p>In my proposed project, I indent to use static backward program slicing to enhance bug report generation. Instead of doing a fix-point algorithm on the control flow graph (CFG) though, my solution would be implemented on the abstract syntax tree (AST). This solution would only be an estimation, so I only propose to add more information to the bug reports, and research whether program slicing could be used for bug path shortening as a followup work.</p>

<p>Also, data preprocessing is an important step involved in machine learning field to achieve high accuracy, and by providing string utility function, such as removing stop word, or removing punctuation, cleaning of string dataset could be achieved.</p>
<p>I have mentioned in the proposal, which function I would implement and how I would implement it and also have included the timeline. I have briefed about my background and have also added the relevant course work to account for the knowledge needed to build about the project.</p>
<p>I have raised pull request for many function along with the test, which are on review as of now. I would continue to sought out all the issues and looking forward to contribute to the organization.</p>

Discovering the compatible plugins and installing them however is currently a manual job.

This enables LibRoadrunner to simulate models on par with compiled C/C++ code. By combining Libroadrunner with standard optimization algorithms it is possible to use Libroadrunner to fit models to data. At present this is done by writing code to link the standard Python optimizer available via scipy with Libroadrunner. Although this works, it is inefficient and for large models, it is not practical. In this project, we would like to develop a C/C++ based differential evolution plugin that can be used directly by Libroadrunner (after integrating it with RRPlugins) without having to go via Python. This would enable us to provide high performance optimization capabilities.</p>

<p>We aim to add multiprocessing support to VimL, the built-in scripting language of Neovim, by allowing functions to be invoked asynchronously in separate processes and enabling the retrieval of their results through callbacks and by waiting for them on demand in the parent process.
This multiprocessing feature will have a noticeable positive impact on the performance of parallelizable computations and tasks.</p>

It is designed as a backend-agnostic tool with the goal to reach the widest user base and thus contribute to extend best practices among Bayesian inference practitioners.</p>
<p>Two key problems in this field are model comparison and convergence analysis. Model comparison is not trivial because of the different structures and number of parameters of each model. Fortunately, there are some information criteria (i.e. leave-one-out cross-validation) that can be used for this task. Even though convergence is proven for infinite iterations, it is not the case for finite MCMC runs, which can be arbitrarily bad. Convergence assessment must take into account both intra- and inter-chain correlations.</p>
<p>ArviZ implements many of these algorithms for diagnostic and comparison, at least at a preliminary level, but it still lacks plots and tools to ease and improve its interpretation. This project seeks to design and implement these tools. Moreover, it will pay special attention to testing and documentation with examples not only of the new functionalities, but also of the already implemented ones.</p>

Regression trees are defined by recursively partitioning the input space, and defining a local model in each resulting region of input space in order to approximate some unknown function. BARTs are useful and flexible model to capture interactions and non-linearities and have been proved useful tools for variable selection.</p>
<p>Bayesian Additive Regression Trees will allow PyMC3 users to perform regressions with a “canned” non-parametric model. By simple calling a method, users will obtain the mean regressor plus the uncertainty estimation in a fully Bayesian way. This can be used later to predict on hold-out data. Furthermore, the implemented BART model will allow experience users to specify their own priors for the specific problem they are tackling, improving performance substantially.</p>

At the same time, it also has a Quantum Information Processing (QIP) submodule representing ideal quantum circuits.

Therefore, it is important to support many fundamental operators usually available for <code>ndarray</code> libraries (e.g. those provided by NumPy and SciPy) as well as special operators focusing deep learning applications (e.g. convolution, pooling, activation functions, etc.). While Chainer implements many of these operators, ChainerX still has low coverage. Full coverage of Chainer’s operators (<code>chainer.functions</code>) and more coverage of NumPy APIs is needed.
Linear algebra operations form the backbone for most of the computation components for many machine learning methods and simulations of physical systems. This project aims at extending ChainerX capability for common numerical linear algebra routines.</p>

Intuitively, this doesn’t represent a genome but rather a consensus. A workaround used today  is holding variation data in VCF files that don’t update the reference meaning the reference will always represent the genome as it <strong>was</strong> not as it <strong>is</strong> or as it’s <strong>evolving</strong>. It’s clear that the current method of representing genomes is not ideal.
There is a need for a representing the reference in a data structure that contains its inherent variation. Different methods have been tried and the variant graph is a promising one. The way the graph works is by representing the variation within the genome as alternative paths one can traverse the graph through and conserved regions as nodes without alternative paths to the get to the next node; we then index the nodes for querying and alignment.
Moreover, variation graphs hold an advantage with rapidly evolving genomes and short read data that could get thrown out when it doesn’t have a place to align to in the reference; with the variant graph short reads should reads could align to alternative nodes.</p>

<p>OpenRoberta is a learning platform that uses a graphical programming language to program different robots. One of the robots supported by OpenRoberta is the Lego EV3, and it supports it in two main ways which both require a custom firmware.
The problem with this approach is that the process of running a program include many steps and takes a lot of time. A simpler approach is needed, since a faster solution could increase the usage of OpenRoberta with EV3, especially in competitions.</p>

<p>Qt is an open source cross platform framework facilitating GUI applications development, for mobile, desktop and embedded devices. Although the framework is written in C++, it brings with it a meta-language (or modelling language), QML. To accelerate UI development, QML provides the Qt Quick Controls module with ready made widget types, each supported by a C++ class, like Button or Switch, ready to be styled and modified at our project needs. The module is currently on version 2.4 but there is no support for Calendar in the latest version, to be more specific, the Calendar was lastly provided in version 1.4 of the Qt Quick Controls module that was released with the Qt 5.3 version.</p>
<p>Expected Results</p>
<p>The Qt Calendar widget is updated, modified accordingly and ported into Qt 5.12 and Qt Quick Controls 2 current version following the QtQC2 module standards and supporting all features like styling. The Calendar, ideally would have a Template type where from properties like background and/or contentItem can be set for style customisation &amp; switching support. Also, it should be possible to be instantiated as a standalone QML type and be styled locally for regular usage.</p>

Currently, <code>git-issue</code> can import data from GitHub's issue management interface, but <strong>not</strong> export them. This is limiting in the following ways:</p>

That way, if someone is logged in a certain location, they should see only those encounters, observations, and patients registered in that location. But the System Developer account should be able to see patients in all locations.</p>

Earlier these software were only web based but now with the advent of mobile technologies our mobiles phones are becoming capable enough to do any task which can be done on the desktop but rather with more flexibility, mobility and with just a few touches.
 Thus the Nigeria Telemedicine App will standout as another example that helps overcome the day to day struggle of manually documenting everything or operating on large desktop systems. Patients can avail fast medical services by register themselves through this mobile app mentioning minimal details about themselves and their ailment.The app then informs the patient regarding when can he expect a call from the doctor. The app also provides an emergency feature that helps the user call an ambulance and provide information about performing CPR, choking prevention maneuvers , stopping excessive bleeding, delivering a baby etc.</p>

The Wikidata project contains structured data about items, and statements about the relationships between items. In recent years, OpenStreetMap has gained a large number of Wikidata tags, and the information from the Wikidata database should improve the importance rankings and search results from Nominatim. To accomplish this objective, it will be necessary to create a script that can process a Wikidata dump and extract the information that would be useful to Nominatim, then import the data it into the Nominatim database. Nominatim already uses Wikipedia links to improve search results, and where Wikidata is available it can help determine the correct Wikipedia link that should be used whenever a Wikipedia link does not exist for an OSM object. This can be done both by directly matching objects to their Wikipedia links via Wikidata, and also by ensuring that links are made to the correct type of object and that links are not made to vague pages such as those that describe brands or other information that is not relevant to search result ranking.</p>

With the project was achieved implemented a new set of topology rules for vector datasets validation and fixing, that improve and expand the existing before.
At present, this tool provides a group of integrity rules that check the validation of the geometries relationship in the data. Is provided a new set of tools to navigate, find and fix validation errors different from each topology rule. This project analyzes, implement and optimize a new set of rules that are incorporated into the Topology Framework. These tools were created using Jython through the Scripting composer tool of gvSIG.
To future, in order to continue developing the project, some of the possible improvements would be implemented more actions and develop more rules.</p>

-Then would add new visualizations for the extracted details and also some logic to classify the record in the database as high risk ip because now we would have more information from the packet and not limited to IP Address and country
-Also in between testing modules and removing duplicated codes I would work on PR reviews and issues (if there are any raised or found)
-Finally at the end would document all the work I did in the wiki section of the project.</li>

It is the reason you go bonkers playing Flappy Bird. However, it would be difficult and expensive to represent each object using its exact geometry, so a better idea would be to put those objects in bounding volumes or CollisionSolids. These CollisionSolids are mathematically defined, so by using ""some math"", a collision system would be able to detect their intersections with each other.</p>

This will also provide a foundation for possible expansion to test other local model implementations in PySAL. Additionally, since the functionality to predict the dependent variable at unsampled locations is not supported for the MGWR model in PySAL, this project also aims to enable predictions for MGWR.</p>

It helps by creating monitors to be checked when Scrapy spiders run, like tests, and perform actions to notify Scrapy users that the spider could have any problem during run. Today an user can be notified via email and Slack, but anyone can create actions to be performed if you have an integration.
Today, Spidermon uses manual configuration to setup projects, which is good for experienced users, but it’s not helpful for whom wants to have a quick setup. Also, Scrapy already have this feature, together with a good documentation.
My idea for this project is to create a robust CLI for Spidermon setup. A user would be able to enable and configure Spidermon monitors, actions and item validations, and be presented with a detailed help menu upon request.</p>

A large amount of research has taken place considering changes in mean and variance in time series. However, a typical assumption is that the error process is independent. Similarly more and more users of existing packages, for example changepoint, are facing problems using real world data due to the dependence structures present. There are several methods available in the literature that are not available in open source code.  This project plans to address this by adding this functionality to a popular CRAN package, changepoint.</p>

Based on early work from Joseph Grinnell and G. Evelyn Hutchinson most of tools in this field consider the environmental characteristics where species are found to model their niches via correlative approaches. Currently, this methods are used widely and their applications include disease risk mapping, climate change risk predictions, conservation biology, among others. Physiological data suggests that Grinnellian niches are convex in nature and they may probably have an ellipsoidal form when multiple dimensions are considered. However, among the available software in the field, algorithms to model ecological niches as ellipsoids in the environmental space are scarce. Several analyses, not currently available, can be performed assuming ellipsoidal niches, especially if recent  literature is considered. This project aims to develop an R package of specialized tools to perform multiple analyses of ecological niches using ellipsoids. A broad community of researchers and students will find this open source tools useful in performing their analyses.</p>

The importance of these two families is that they go beyond the symmetric tail behaviors of the skew-t distributions, as described in Azzalini and Capitanio (2014), and hence can provide better fits for certain data arising in applications, especially for asset returns.

Furthermore, the package will compute confidence intervals for the parameter estimates, and hypothesis tests concerning the parameters.

During <em>intraday analyses</em> such investment decisions are monitored and potentially adapts depending on real-time observed market conditions.
In <em>post-trade analysis</em>, the occurred transaction cost is measured and hence orders execution performance is evaluated.

The latter distributional semantics approach uses Deep Structured Semantic Models (DSSM) to create word embeddings of lexical units (LUs) to resolve the inconsistency in FrameNet hierarchy, tag LUs with their missing frames, and locate new frames using SemCor corpus.

OCR on television news shows would recognize any text appear on a screen and translate this text to editable formate at one-second intervals.
During OCR development some challenges appear, one of these challenges is to detect duplication if text repeats in successive frames, the application will handle this case.
Another challenge is to see if it is time to make space between words or not (i.e. space detection) as the output may be all words concatenated together and space some times not detectable in frames. My work will be based on CNN and BLSTM VS open source libraries the best accuracy will be deployed. 
The project will be deployed on HPC machines using Singularity containers.
Another contribution will be also done an enhancement on ASR (Automatic speech recognition) which is done last year by Ahmed Ismail. This project will be trained on a new dataset and new modification to the architecture may be done (if required ) to increase it is accuracy.</p>

For this, it is necessary to store the graph structure used to represent the knowledge of the world that the robot possesses. In RoboComp, when robots need to perform complex tasks, its behaviour is based on missions. The mission begin from an initial state and through different transitions reaches a final state, that is, the robot completes the mission. The states are represented by a graph. 
My proposal is to use a JSON structure to store this graph. This allows its storage as a collection of documents in MongoDB. Consequently, each document could represent a state of the robot. Also, this slot is intended to study the viability of Neo4J for this purpose, as far as I am concerned, the best option would be to use the polyglot persistence, that consists in to use the database best suited for the type of data, in our case MongoDB, and in to use the database best suited for the type of queries, in our case Neo4j. Specifically I think that Neo4j Doc Manager could be our best choice.</p>

Integration testing. Unit tests and UI tests will be written for the android project to test the new features and code changes done in the project before getting merged in the main repository. The goal is to confirm that no new code gets merged unless it passes all the tests that will be run at build time i.e. the new code works as designed and does not cause any regression issues by breaking other functionality/tests. The test infrastructure will be designed in a way that it will tell the developer what method or function or Which piece of code is causing the error or tests to fail. So It will be easy to find which portion of code is causing an error and the developer can fix that.
Proper test automation consists of the generation of test coverage reports as it helps in

The aim here is to implement some of the important features that the application lacks, and also side by side replacing some legacy libraries with a new one to increase performance as well as user experience and last but not least resolving discovered as well as undiscovered bugs.
I think the most important feature that app lacks is the ability to fully share files. It can right now download and view already shared files but there no way to upload a new one.
Second, an important feature that really makes Rocket Chat standout from others are slash commands, It allows the user to do trivial actions, like invite a user or archive a channel in fewer tabs 
Third, add in app notification so user can be notified even when he is using app<br>
And last but not least I will be redesigning the settings panel of app and adding new options to it like Licence and contact us</p>

Rocket.chat itself is the repository for much of that content but the rest typically resides in other applications such as github or jira or google docs, many of which are third party services and so the content is not owned by the community that hosts the Rocket.chat server. In one particular scenario, a user may want to write an article and “publish” it to groups or contacts within Rocket.chat. Today that would have to be done typically using a third party service. What if instead article creation, searching, and storage were integrated with Rocket.chat such that each user could maintain his or her own library of articles and contacts of that user could subscribe to see new articles posted by that user and to discuss those articles using something like Rocket.chat Threads.</p>

<p>As Software Heritage works on archiving and sharing source code, one of the major tasks is to ingest the latest source code available from all the possible sources(forges and package managers). 
The goal of this project is to increase the archive coverage by making listers and loaders for different forges and package managers.
Listers are components that crawl the APIs of software forges (e.g., Bitbucket, Gitorious, Sourceforge, ...) and return a list of the software available in it whereas Loaders take a bundle of software (tarball, Git repository ...) and load it into Software Heritage, by adapting it so that it matches the archive data model.</p>

Even when users are interested in a handful of syscalls, strace will intercept all syscall made by the observed processes, involving several context switches per syscall.</p>
<p>Since Linux 3.5, userspace applications can rely on seccomp-bpf to filter the syscalls they want to trace. In that case, the set of monitored syscalls is filtered in the kernel, using cBPF, before any context switch to userspace. strace could leverage seccomp-bpf to avoid tracing syscalls users don't want.
The tracing landscape of Linux also drastically evolved in recent years. In particular, user applications can rely on eBPF programs to filter and aggregate data of interest in the kernel, with low overhead.</p>
<p>During this Google Summer of Code, I will finish and merge the works started to 1) rely on seccomp-bpf to filter syscalls in kernel space and 2) allow strace to use alternative backends. That second work will come with a tracepoint/BPF proof of concept to ensure strace supports diverse backends, beyond the usual ptrace model.</p>

And if such a computation happens at the UI threads, it will block all the things until the computation is done. The above will results in a bad experience while using the web to render the results and so on. And it is natural to come up with the idea that is doing a multi-threads model that let the main thread(ui thread) run for rendering UI and listen to the results from other threads and let another thread opens when the computation is needed. This WebWorker is the base for the multi-thread model over the browser. We can use the WebWorker to achieve the paradigm that separates the heavy computation apart from UI rendering.</p>

The architecture of TensorFlow has been elegantly designed such that it is possible to be extended in big data, medical imaging, and physical sciences.

Thus, easy environments for reinforcement learning agents are those with dense reward signals. In these environments, most algorithms included in TF-Agents already achieve good results. However, in sparse-reward environments such as Montezuma’s Revenge from Atari 2600, such algorithms fail to discover optimal behavior as it rarely finds any nonzero reward. To mitigate this problem, multiple methods have been proposed to add intrinsic rewards or “curiosity” to existing algorithms to extend the capability of these algorithms.</p>
<p>This project will implement three curiosity modules to TF-Agents: pseudocount-based exploration via Context Tree Switching (CTS), Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and Random Network Distillation (RND). These modules will be implemented as modules so that they can be enabled or disabled in one line for existing reinforcement learning algorithms in TF-Agents. With the addition of these modules, the users will be able to gain meaningful results without careful reward shaping on sparse-reward environments.</p>

The target is to first containerize the major components in OODT (file manager, resource manager and workflow manager) using Docker. Each component will then have its own Dockerfile and Maven build execution using the dockerfile-maven plugin. Next, the initial OODT deployment tool will be created using Kubernetes. Once this is done, the existing OODT Distributed Configuration Management feature will be integrated with this tool to handle dynamic configuration management. As a later step, the deployment could be upgraded to work with Helm or KNative.</p>
<p>Through this project, OODT will gain the ability to seamlessly manage OODT components regardless of the deployment environment. Technologies including Docker, Kubernetes and Maven will be required to carry out this project.</p>

Originally proposed by a team at Google in 2010, its main purposes were to be a flexible, but structured language for the web. Its syntax was (and still is) very close to other languages (namely Java or C#) which makes it easy for newcomers to start using Dart.</p>
<p>Nowadays there is a new main purpose for the language: Flutter. A project that has been unveiled in 2015 and that utilizes Dart as its programming language. Currently developers use the project to deliver native cross platform mobile apps to both iOS and Android. In the future there will be other compile targets such as the web, or desktop applications.</p>

However, the already notorious scalability problem of symbolic execution is exacerbated by assertions. In our previous studies, we have introduced parallelism to check assertions with Symbolic Pathfinder (SPF) either with static analysis or dynamic analysis. In this work, we propose to combine static and dynamic analyses for parallel analysis to achieve better scalability, to further reduce the cost of symbolic execution using compositional and incremental assertion checking with SPF when the code or assertions are changed.</p>

Not only has APR had great influence on academia recently, but also it has received considerable attention from the industry. Motivated by the potential impact of APR, in this project, we propose to build a repair framework that improves upon on past successful work VFix and S3.</p>
<p>In this project, we aim to fix NPE bugs. We will use data flow analysis as proposed in VFix to accurately localize buggy code fragments in program under repair. We then use S3 to semantically reason about the identified buggy code fragments via dynamic symbolic execution on test cases. However, simply relying on test cases may not be sufficient. We thus plan to further enhance the semantic reasoning in S3 with the ability to leverage user-provided annotations. After this step, we obtain a set of constraints that constitutes specifications of the program. We then propose a program synthesis technique that improve the template-based repair in VFix and syntax-guided synthesis in S3 to synthesize repairs.</p>

It is an essential task in many biological studies today, including population and medical studies. The initial stages of de-novo assembly require the construction of a de-bruijn graph (DBG) from sequencing reads, the compression of a de-bruijn graph into a unitig graph, and the compression of multiple unitigs and nodes into contigs, supported by evidence from mapping paired-end reads. A coherent ecosystem of computational tools and packages allow researchers to quickly implement and test their ideas. For bioinformatics, Julia already offers such an ecosystem in the form of the BioJulia &amp; EcoJulia projects, and additional independent packages.
This project will add sequence assembly tools to the BioJulia ecosystem, specifically: 1) DBG construction from reads, 2) UG construction from a DBG and 3) Constructing contigs using unitigs. These tools will allow researchers to quickly construct and analyze the contigs obtained from a set of reads.</p>

To reduce the amount of human intervention in surveying for more accurate and quicker results, I have submitted a proposal in which I plan to make an Android application which will use Machine Learning, Computer Vision through the Google Cloud Vision API and Tensorflow library to perform image analysis and aid the surveying process. The app will render the relevant PPI using the Apache-Fineract SPM API. Further, images may be uploaded to the Cloud Vision Models or fed to the embedded Tensorflow models which are made available using Firebase ML Kit to obtain a report of various objects detected and inferences derived relevant to PPI questionnaire.</p>

The overall performance of this kind of networks are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the signal propagation through the wireless link, thereby, a proper modeling of the channel behavior is of primary importance to obtain reliable results from the simulations. This project aims to tackle this issue by proposing an extension of the spectrum module to model both frequency and spatial-dependent phenomena, and to account for the directional behavior of the signal propagation. This will be achieved by implementing the modeling framework described in 3GPP TR 38.901, which includes the statistical characterization of different propagation environments, supports the modeling of multi-antenna systems, and, thanks to its modularity, can be easily extended with new environments or other additional features. Even if it has been specifically designed for the simulation of cellular networks, it supports frequency bands between 0.5 and 100 GHz, thus can be used even for other wireless technologies.</p>

I will start with an executable binary for a basic Hello World program, and incrementally add support for linking to shared system and user libraries. Time permitting, I will work with my mentors to enable support and/or work arounds to enable linking to C and other languages.</p>
<p>My approach will be similar to how the .NET Core creates self-contained and framework dependent deployment binaries. I have chosen this as a model as it has proven capable of running on Linux, Windows, and MacOS systems. While my work may focus initially on either Windows and the Portable Executable (PE) or Linux and Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), this approach will hopefully ensure a path forward that will eventually be capable of producing executable binaries on all popular modern operating systems.</p>
<p>The basic method which the .NET Core uses to create executable binaries is by creating a manifest of information in the operating system dependent executable binary format which is linked to .NET’s runtime library, and handed to a .NET “main” function which executes the user program.</p>

<p>Because processes can encode structured and typed business logic with instrumentation points based on <code>tracing</code>, a domain-specific debugger built upon those can provide powerful, ad hoc tooling, e.g. filtering events by connection id, execution context etcetera.
As instrumentation points of underlying libraries are collected as well, it is easy to observe their behaviour and interaction. This is an eminent advantage over traditional debuggers, where the user instead observes the implementation.</p>

The Tungsten Fabric framework addresses this challenge using a software-defined networking
stack, so as to provide a cloud-grade single network fabric capable of interacting with diverse
multi-cloud environments in a secure and scalable manner. Following the increasing use of
containers, one of Tungsten Fabric's use case involves integrating its virtual networking stack with the Kubernetes framework to provide a range of multi-tenant networking features. A significant
problem with this use case is the lack of automation and documentation around installation and
setup of Tungsten Fabric. This project aims to simplify the process of launching Tungsten Fabric in
Kubernetes. To do so, we will documentation of the installation process along with a walk-through of some use cases. This will help newcomers to quickly get started with the framework.</p>

<p>1.Make it much easier to quickly and conveniently test any incoming webhook integrations. This will make things a whole lot easier for developers creating or reviewing new bots. I plan on creating a web-based GUI for this purpose.</p>
<p>2.Enable us to store the headers for each sample payload alongside their fixtures. But at the same time allow them to be dynamically generated (instead having them necessarily be fixed/static).</p>
<p>3.Allow user's to configure their incoming webhooks bots based on certain parameters that we can specify on an integration-per-integration basis.</p>
<p>4.Create a systematic and convenient way to allow integrations to make a callback request to a third-party API to gain extra information about events as required.</p>
<p>5.Making miscellaneous improvements and tweaks that pop up over the course of the summer to specific integrations. Add new integrations as needed.</p>
<p>The second part of this project involves improving Zulip's OpenAPI documentation system (the supporting code and tests, not necessarily writing the actual documentation itself).</p>

Also, the user base for it has been steadily growing; but most of them only use it as a temporary client. So, this summer my goal would be to convert Zulip Terminal from being a temporary client to a primary client by implementing the necessary features.</p>

Zulip is a team chat software so experience around searching and message view is a priority. My project involves improving this experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Search entire organisation's public streams at once including messages sent by other members before a user joint.</li>
<li>Not marking new unread messages as read when searching for older messages</li>
<li>Fixing the ability to view/search messages sent by deactivated user in Group PM chats.</li>
<li>Ability to create bot with admin privileges</li>
<li>Some code refactoring and fixing few high priority bugs.</li>
<li>Rebasing and fixing failing tests of an old PR which allows zulip users to have multiple api keys.</li>
